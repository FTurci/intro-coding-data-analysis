    " > **Demonstrator Notes:** This question aims to get students thinking about how they can use `if` statements to navigate the robot environment. It should be noted that students are **not asked** to stop the robot from turning if it senses a wall to the left or right. The reason that we do not ask for this is that the robot could be in a dead-end (e.g. there is a wall left, right and ahead). If we ask the students to prevent the robot from turning whenever it senses a wall, then in a dead-end the robot will get stuck and the while loop will execute indefinitely. If you see students with this issue, remind them that the question does not ask them to modify the turning behaviour of the robot - it only asks them to modify the call to `robot.move()`."

    " > **Demonstrator Notes:** Some general advice for this question: \n",
    " > - Make sure students have their browser zoomed far enough out so that they can see both the `Robot Console` and the maze at the same time. \n",
    " > - If they haven't already, advise students to set the robot delay so that the robot moves slowly (e.g. `robot.delay = 2`). This will allow them to verify that what the robot is printing the correct response in real time.\n",
    " > - There are many ways to approach this task; however, one of the most convenient is to count the number of walls around the robot, as counting the wall allows you to handle the `dead-end`, `single-wall` and `unbordered-square` cases immediately.\n",
    " > - When students are trying to count the number of walls, let them first write out the `robot.sense(\"AHEAD\")`, `robot.sense(\"LEFT\")`,... etc calls one-at-a-time. Once they have done this, point out the repetitive nature of the code to them, and explain why this code might be cleaner using a loop. \n",
    " > - When distinguishing between `corner`s and `corridor`s it is easier to list the situations in which you are in a corridor (there is a wall to the left and right, or there is a wall behind and ahead) then the situations where you are in a corner (there is a wall ahead and left, ahead and right, behind and left, behind and right)."
