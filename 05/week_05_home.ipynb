Over the next few weeks, we'll begin shifting our focus away from Python's built-in features and towards powerful external packages, such as `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `pandas`, that will no doubt be invaluable in your future studies and professional work.\n",

    "You will find that the challenge problems this week are much more open-ended than those you have encountered in previous classes. At first, this might feel a bit intimidating, but please do not fret - you already have all the skills necessary to complete the tasks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some general tips to help make the challenges feel less daunting:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Plan before you code:** Before writing any code, try taking notes about the background material. Once you understand the background material, think about how you might approach the task by hand, and jot the steps you would perform down on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Clarify inputs and outputs:** When getting started, think about the following questions:\n",
    ">   - What information do I have before I start coding? *(These are likely my inputs.)*\n",
    ">   - What do I want my code to produce? *(This is my output.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Look for structure and repetition:** When converting your thoughts to code, consider the below:\n",
    ">  - Which steps of the computation are repetitive? *(Think loops!)*\n",
    ">  - Which steps of the computation are self-contained? *(Perhaps, I should use a function for these...)*\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Divide and conquer:** Try to break the task down into smaller, more manageable chunks, and solve each piece one at a time before putting them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Talk things through:** If you're struggling to get started, try talking the question through with a peer or class tutor. You might be surprised how much this helps to organise your thoughts!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Use resources:** Don't be afraid to use google or Python documentation when you're thinking about the best way to implement a solution. Sometimes the act of googling alone can help spark new ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Trust your own process:** Try to avoid using AI when deciding how to structure your code. You will find it much easier to understand and refine your work if the structure comes from your own reasoning.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Above all, remember that coding can be hard! At times, it might feel like you're running into the same problem over and over without making much progress. If you feel this way, don't worry - this is a perfectly normal part of the process. If you keep trying, you will get there!"
