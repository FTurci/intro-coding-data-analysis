    "### Measuring Gravity with a Picket Fence and Photogate\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic experiment in introductory physics is the *photogate picket fence* experiment. In this setup, a *picket fence* (a clear plastic strip with evenly spaced opaque bars) is dropped vertically through a *photogate sensor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/picketfence3.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The photogate shines an infrared beam across a small gap. A sensor on the other side detects whether the beam makes it through or not. If the beam is *blocked* (by one of the bars), the sensor records `'x'`. If the beam is *not blocked*, the sensor records `'o'`. Every $\\Delta t = 0.5$ milliseconds ($=0.0005s$) the photogate logs whether the beam is blocked or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the bars on the picket fence are evenly spaced, the vertical distance between the start of one bar and the start of the next is always the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta d = 5 \\text{cm (constant distance between bars).} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the picket fence falls through the photogate, each bar successively blocks the beam. By measuring the time between when one bar starts blocking the beam and when the next bar does, we can estimate the *velocity* of the falling object. From changes in velocity, we can then estimate the *acceleration due to gravity*.\n"

    " > **Note:** Before starting this challenge, if you haven't already, you may wish to read the sections on dictionaries in the [week 1 intermediate notebook](../01/week_01_intro_to_data_types_intermediate.ipynb). This will be helpful in what follows.\n",

    "data_dict[\"Trial 1\"] = \"oooxxxoooxexo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "This string represents the sensor readings for the first trial. Each character corresponds to a single timepoint, spaced by $\\Delta t = 0.0005$ s. We can interpret this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first three characters (`\"ooo\"`) mean the beam was unblocked at times $t = 0 \\text{ms}$, $5 \\text{ms}$, and $10 \\text{ms}$,\n",
    "- The next three characters (`\"xxx\"`) indicate the beam was blocked at $t = 15 \\text{ms}$, $20 \\text{ms}$, and $25 \\text{ms}$,\n",
    "- The next three (`\"ooo\"`) show the beam was unblocked again,\n",
    "- At $t = 50 \\text{ms}$, the character is `'e'`, indicating that the sensor glitched,\n",
    "- This is followed by `'x'` and `'o'` at the final two timepoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Across the $100$ trials, several different picket fences were used. Some had the same number of bars, while others did not. Consequently, the number of black and white bars varied between trials."
