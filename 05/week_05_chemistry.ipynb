An atom with a fixed number of neutrons is known as an *isotope* and we usually denote isotopes by the element name followed by the *mass number*: that is, the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom. For instance, `carbon-12` is an isotope of carbon with a mass number of `12`. You might also see this written as $^{12}C$ or $^{12}_6C$, if we want to highlight that the atom possesses $6$ protons."
