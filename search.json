This notebook is designed for students who already have substantial experience with Python and feel confident working with both the Beginner and Intermediate material.\nYour task today is to carefully read through the content and complete the exercises at the end. These exercises are more challenging and are intended to deepen your understanding of how Python handles data behind the scenes.\nIn this notebook, you will explore the critical differences between immutable and mutable data types in Python. Specifically, you will learn how Python handles copying and references, which can be critical knowledge when it comes to debugging complex code.\nWork through the examples carefully, and take your time with the exercises. They are designed to stretch your understanding and prepare you for advanced applications of Python.",

    "section": "Immutable vs Mutable",
    "text": "Immutable vs Mutable\nIn Python, all data types can be described as either “immutable” or “mutable”.\nTo understand the difference between “immutable” and “mutable” types, it may be useful to introduce the notion of a reference. You can think of a reference as an address which tells us where some data lives physically on a machine. When we talk about variables, we really are talking about reference’s (which we have named) that point us to some data in memory.\nWhen you reassign the value of a variable in your code, there are actually two possible things that could be happening. The reference could be changed (i.e. the variable now represents a different place in memory), or the data itself could be changed (i.e. the variable is still “looking” at the same location in memory, but the data that is stored there has changed).\nWhat is important to know here is that when you change the value of a variable which has an “immutable” data type you are changing a reference whereas when you are changing “mutable” variables you are changing the data itself. Examples of mutable data types in Python include the list, dictionary and the set. On the other hand, examples of immutable data types are given by the int, float, decimal, bool and the tuple. In general, the more complicated data types discussed so far are “mutable”.\nThe distinction between a data type being “mutable” or “immutable” may seem dull and/or trivial but, in practice, can result in some very unexpected behaviour, especially when multiple variables are using the same reference (i.e. “looking” at the same place in memory)!\nFor example, in the below code we may expect a and b to have different values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they do! However, if we change a from being 7 to a list containing 7, perhaps surprisingly, changing the value of a also changes the value b!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both the examples above, we start by assigning a and b as references to the same location in memory.\nIn the first example, when we assign a=10, we are telling Python that a must change where it is “looking” in the computers memory. This does not have any effect on the value of b.\nIn the second example, however, when we assign a[0]=10, we are telling Python that the data stored in the location which a is “looking” at at must be changed. As b is also “looking” at this location in memory, this does have an effect on the value of b. It has changed!\nIt is worth noting though that if an operation is performed then a copy might be made:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, to ensure we are working with a copy of a and not just a reference to the same variable, we can use the list constructor (see below).\n\nNote: In this case a is a list so we use the list constructor. For other datatypes similar constructors exist and would be used in this situation (e.g. set, dict, etc…).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Errors of this type can often cause extremely anti-intuitive behaviour, including unexpected interactions between functions.\nFor example, in the below a function is called on a variable b, yet a seemingly unrelated variable a was affected by calling the function. This is because a and b were both references to the same object in memory, as oppose to being distinct copies of the object.\nIf you are not familiar with functions, do not worry; these will be covered in depth later in the course and, for now, move past this example.",

This identifier tells us exactly where some data lives physically on a machine - essentially showing us the reference that a variable is pointing to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith immutable data types, when you reassign a variable, you are changing the reference (the variable now points to a different location in memory). Let’s see this with our integer example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith mutable data types, when you modify the data, you are changing the data itself (the reference stays the same - the variable is still “looking” at the same location in memory).

Try a few below:\n\nWarning: A common mistake made by new users of Python is to use ^ for exponentiation (e.g. \\(2^5\\)). In fact, in Python ^ represents the logical XOR operator and the ** operator represents exponentiation. By performing your own research online, see if you can work out what the XOR function is doing here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can combine operations using round brackets, ( and ), much in the same way you would in everyday math.

The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer). In python we can see the length of a string by using the len() function. In fact, this function can be used to assess the length of many different variable types such as lists, tuples, sets and so on (more on those later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief interlude: In Python, you can add comments to your code using the # symbol. Comments are lines of text that are ignored when the code runs, but they play an important role in explaining what your code is doing. Writing clear and meaningful comments as you code is considered best practice. It helps others (and your future self) understand your logic and what you are trying to do. Below is a simple example that shows how to use comments in Python. Make sure you are comfortable with this, as commenting is a crucial habit for anyone working with code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding: What is the difference between print(2 + 3) and print(\"2\" + \"3\")? What happens if you try x = \"hello\" + 5? Using the below box, write some code to answer these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString manipulation\nPython has many useful tools for manipulating strings. One such function is the format function, which allows you to insert variables of different types into strings. Note that x in the below example does not need to be a string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother useful tool is the concatenation operater; +. Concatenation in programming is another way for saying “join together”. See the below for an example of how this is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the previous example could be done using concatenation instead of the format funtion. Note though that we must be careful and convert x from an integer to a string, using str(), in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther useful functions for string manipulation include\n\nstrip; which, by default, removes any white space from the beginning and end of a string. However, you can also specify which characters you wish to remove.\nsplit; splits a string by specified character (known as a seperator), and returns a list. By default, the separator is a space and this function splits a sentence into individual words.\nreplace; this returns a string with some specified value replaced with another specified value.\nupper; this makes a string all uppercase.\nlower; this makes a string all lowercase.\n\nSeveral examples are given below. Please make sure you understand what each of these functions does before moving on to the next section. There are many other functions available and a good resource for learning about each individual function and trying them for yourself is the w3 schools python reference site.",

For example, consider the below code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see it print True, which makes sense as 128 is indeed larger than 100. Try changing the numbers above; can you make this print False?\nIn this code, the expression 128 &gt; 100 is a boolean statement. We can make this clearer like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code is identical to the previous, but we have now saved the True/False value as my_boolean.\nSome common boolean operators include:\n\nnot: This negates the value of a variable (i.e. turns True to False and False to True).\nand: This is a logical and.\nor: This is a logical or.\nis: This checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n==: This checks whether two variables are equal in value (Note: This shouldn’t be confused for the assigment operator; =).\n!=: This checks whether two variables are not equal in value.\n\nBoolean operators in Python are designed to be intuitive and as close to natural language as possible. The below code demonstrates how the boolean operations and, or, == and != and not are used. Try changing the values of a and b to ensure you understand how these operations work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther common relational expressions which give True/False output include &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt; and &gt; for numeric datatypes (e.g. ints and floats) and in for collection datatypes (such as lists or tuples, which we shall look at next).",

For example, try moving the type statement before and after the sum in the below block and see how the output is changed. Why does the output change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral inbuilt functions are available for converting between types. The most commonly used of these are the int, float and str functions. Try these out below. Caution: Note how converting z back to a float does not give the original value x. Why do you think this is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe act of converting one data type to another is often referred to as casting. For instance, in the above code, we cast x from a float to a string and then from a string to an integer.\n\nCheck your Understanding: What happens if you try int(\"10.5\")?

By using the operators introduced in the Booleans section of this notebook, construct a boolean variable, my_boolean which is true if and only if \\(y\\) lies strictly between \\(x^2\\) and \\(z^3\\). That is, my_boolean should be true if and only if either \\(x^2&lt;y&lt;z^3\\) or \\(z^3&lt;y&lt;x^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: In the below code, we have two boolean variables; is_raining and have_umbrella. We will assume that these represent the sentences “It is raining outside” and “I have my umbrella with me”, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will assume that you are going to get wet if and only if it is raining outside and you do not have your umbrella. Using logical operators (e.g. and, or, not…), make a new boolean variable that tells you if you are going to get wet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: In this question, we are interested in three boolean variables A, B and C. By performing your own research online, write down (on paper) a “Truth Table” for the expression (A and B) or (not C). Your table should have the following columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nA and B\nnot C\n(A and B) or (not C)\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following box, write some code which computes (A and B) or (not C). By changing the values of A, B and C check the correctness of your truth table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: Below are two variables representing the width and height of a rectangle. Write some code that computes the area, perimeter and length of the diagonal of the rectangle. Your code should print the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5: An object dropped from a height satisfies the SUVAT equations. In particular, it satisfies the following equation:\n\\[v^2 = u^2 + 2as\\]\nwhere - \\(v\\) is the final velocity, - \\(u\\) is the initial velocity, - \\(a\\) is the acceleration, equal to gravity in this case, - \\(s\\) is the distance.\nGiven the object is at rest initially and it’s final velocity is \\(10\\) meters per second, write code to compute the distance it has fallen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6: Building on your answer to Question 5, by researching the SUVAT equations and writing code below, compute the time in seconds that the object spends in freefall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7: Without running code, predict the result of these, then check your answers in Python:\n\n(True and False) or True\nnot (False or False)\nTrue or False and False\nFalse ^ True\n(True and not True) and (False or not False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8: The below code takes two numbers, x and y and computes \\(z=\\frac{x+y}{y^2}\\). For instance, when we set \\(x=1\\) and \\(y=5\\) we get \\(z=0.24\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you were change the inputs, x and y, to 2 and 5. Work out by hand what you would expect \\(z\\) to equal.\nThe below code is the same as the above but the values of x and y have been changed. This time, something has gone wrong! z does not give the expected value. Explain what has happened and how you would fix it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9: Explain why the first code box below prints nothing but the second prints True.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Consider the below variable z. What is it’s datatype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven your answer to the above, you may expect the below code to also print True.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it doesn’t! Why do you think this is?\nHint: Try printing (0.1 + 0.2) and 0.3 seperately. What do you notice?\nQuestion 10: In the code block below, you are given 12 strings:\n\none start_string\n\nten “helper” strings (string1 to string10)\n\none end_string\n\nYour task is to transform the start_string into the end_string using only:\n\nthe start_string\n\nthe helper strings (string1 … string10)\n\nthe .replace() function\n\nA complete solution can be given in 5 replacement steps. We’ve given you the first step to get you started.\nHint: You might not need all ten helper strings.",

Calculate the trajectory of the passenger with respect to the center of the wheel for the duration of 30 seconds, with a time resolution of 2 seconds, assuming they start at the rightmost point of the wheel.\n\nThe problem is a two-dimensional problem. The passenger has coordinates \\(x(t), y(t)\\) and is performing uniform rotational motion, with angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) and radius \\(R\\).\nThe angle formed at which the passenger is located is \\(\\theta(t)\\) and simply evolves as\n\\[\\theta(t) = \\omega t +\\theta_0\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle (\\(\\theta_0=0\\) in our case).\nHence, the trajectory is expressed by\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx(t) & = R\\cos\\theta(t) = R \\cos{\\omega t}+x_0\\\\\ny(t) & = R\\sin\\theta(t)  = R \\sin{\\omega t}+y_0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, we have all the theoretical knowledge that we need to solve the problem.

    "text": "How can we use what we have learnt in the past few workshops to read data from a file? And how can we plot this?\nOne way to then plot this data would be to extract the index and/or multiple columns we are interested in plotting and use matplotlib as we have done before.\nAs an example, we’ll look at a new data file. This contains a simulation of the (fractional) concentration change for two species in a reaction, “A” and “B” where \\(A \\rightarrow B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we open this file more directly in Python when we looked at a text file) we can take quick look at the contents to see what this looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom printing out the first 200 characters, we can see this looks like a table of data with each column separated by spaces. This looks nicely formatted with a title row including the column names and no extra header rows.\nWe will see in the next year that there are dedicate packages to manipulate large tabulated files. However, for now we can exploit numpy as a quick and effective way to read such input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a special kind of array called a structured array, because it has named fields. You can check this by querying the subproperties of the array:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese various names are the fields of the array, corresponding to the columns in the file. This syntax is reminiscent of what we have seen in the case of dictionaries, where keys are used to specific other objects stored in the dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data also has a column for “Time” as the number of seconds elapsed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a plot for time vs concentration of A, we can extract this data from our array\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could then use matplotlib to plot this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simulation shows a clean relationship as concentration decreases over time (in an exponential way).\nSuppose we want to filter our data and plot only concentrations less than 0.5. We can simply create a boolean array that masks the invalid data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have filtered our data to include all fractional concentrations less than (or equal to) 0.5. Notice we have also matched our time values to plot to these concentrations by extracting the index from our new array concentration_A_low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see the slope is similiar (in fact it is the same) between our unfiltered and filtered data (this is due to the exponential relationship).\n\n\nExercise\n\nRe-plot the un-filtered graph created above and add another line to show concentration of B vs time from the data_kinetic_k0005 array on the same plot.\n\n\nCan you include a label for A and B?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the the sum of the concentrations for these two columns (A and B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-plot the graph created in the previous question and add this sum as a third line.\n\n\nConsider: What does this sum tell us about “A” is decaying into “B”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe add the sum of concentrations (A+B) as a third line to the plot. This sum remains very close to 1 throughout the reaction, indicating that as “A” decays, it is converted into “B” without significant loss or gain of total concentration. This demonstrates conservation of mass in the reaction: all of “A” is accounted for as it becomes “B”."

It provides a flexible framework for generating a wide variety of plots and charts, making it a popular choice for data analysis and scientific research. With matplotlib, you can customize every aspect of your figures, from colors and styles to labels and legends.\nWe start by importing the pyplot sub-module from matplotlib.\nThe most widespread convention is to use the shorthand plt to refer to this package with the as syntax and so we can import this in the following way:",

    "section": "Figure and Axes",
    "text": "Figure and Axes\nThere are two main interfaces for plotting using matplotlib.\n\nThe first is to use Pyplot (plt) to create a plot directly e.g. using plt.plot(). This is the type of syntax you may see often when looking online. This way of interacting with and plotting data was created to replicate the functionality of an alternative, and common programming language called MATLAB, which a lot of early Python adopters were familiar with.\nThe second, more modern way to create plots is to use the object-oriented approach where the figure is created first and then explicitly referenced when creating a plot. One way to do this is by calling the subplots() function to create a Figure (the canvas) and an Axes (the x-y axes) object which can then be used for plotting.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nWe can plot using the ax object directly using whichever type of graph we want to create e.g.  - for a simple line graph we can use the plot() function - for a scatter graph we can use the scatter() function. - for a 1D histogram we can the hist() function\nYou can also add multiple graphs to the same set of Axes to plot sets of data on top of each other:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may notice that unlike other Python you have been writing, in Jupyter notebooks you should keep your plotting code together in one code cell as this will immediately be displayed when the code cell is run.\nTo create another plot in a new cell you can create new Figure and Axes objects using the same names fig, ax or name them something different if you’d prefer.\nMatplotlib sample plots - https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html\n\nAside: subplots\nYou may ask why the function for creating a new plot is called subplots(). By default, this function allows you to create one plot on one figure, which is usually what you want for an initial plot. However, it is possible to use the subplots() function to create multiple plots on the same figure. One way to do this is by specifying the number of rows (nrows) and number of columns (ncols) you want when using the subplots() function. Note that this will pass back an array of Axes objects rather than just one which you can then use to plot.\nWe won’t explore this further, but for more details on how this is done have a look at the subplots demo.\n\n\n\nExercise A (Worked through as needed in class)\nFor this exercise, we have created some random sample data which we can plot. Here we have created several numpy arrays each 100 elements long (based on num_points).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a scatter plot of x_range versus random_sample1.\n\n\nStart by creating your Figure and Axes objects (fig, ax) using the subplots function\nUse the scatter method to plot your data using your Axes object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a line plot of x_range versus random_sample2\n\n\nAs before, start by creating your Figure and Axes objects (fig, ax) using the subplots function\nUse the plot method to plot your data using your Axes object",

For instance, you can:\n\nchange the style, colour etc. of your initial plot (e.g. see examples within matplotlib decoration)\nadd additional features such as axis labels, legend etc.\n\nThe code below demonstrates how we could customise the plot above using these inputs:\n\n1. Using more of the available plotting options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can include more inputs for both our subplots function and our plotting functions such as plot() and scatter():\n\nFor the subplots() initial step we specified the figure size, figsize, as an input. This is set using a tuple of (width, height) in inches.\nFor the plot function we set:\n\nthe colour to be a named colour called “slategrey” using the color input\nthe style of the line to be dashed, using “–” and the linestyle input\n\nFor the scatter function we set:\n\nthe colour to be a named colour called “indianred” using the color input\nthe marker shape to a cross shape, using “+” and the marker input\nsize to be 60 (area of the marker) using the s input\n\n\nFor in-built options see: - Colours - https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html - Line style - https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html - Markers - https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html\n\n\n2. Setting properties on the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we set additional parameters for the plot - the x and y labels and an x limit. We have done this by calling the relevant functions (e.g. set_xlabel, set_ylim) on our ax variable.\nFor some examples of different Axes functions of this type see: - Axes - labels and limits - https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html#axis-labels-title-and-legend - Axes - tick labels - https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html#ticks-and-tick-labels\n\n\n3. Additional labelling - legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA legend can be created using the .legend() function (method) and this will use the label value supplied when creating each plot. If ax.legend() is not included then, even if a label variable is specified, no legend will be added to the plot.\nSee: - legend function - https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.legend.html",

    "text": "Element-wise operations on 1D arrays\nElement-wise operations in numpy allow you to perform arithmetic or mathematical functions on each corresponding element of arrays. For example, if you have two arrays of the same length, arr1 and arr2, you can add them directly: arr1 + arr2. This will produce a new array where each element is the sum of the elements at the same position in the original arrays. Similarly, you can use other operators (-, *, /) or numpy functions (np.sqrt(arr1), np.cos(arr1)) to apply operations to each element individually. The arrays must have compatible shapes for these operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen 1D arrays have different lengths, you need to be careful about the operations you perform. Element-wise operations: Operations such as arr1 + arr3 or arr1 * arr3 require arrays to have the same length or compatible shapes. If the lengths differ, numpy will raise a ValueError due to shape mismatch.",

This joins the arrays end-to-end, creating a new array containing all elements from both arrays in order. Concatenation is useful for combining datasets or extending arrays.\nTo find unique elements, use np.unique(arr1), which returns an array of the distinct values in arr1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Example: Creating a 100 x 100 grid containing a square where the centre of that square is at (80, 40) and the width is 30.\nTo check whether an (x, y) position is within the square we want to define, we want to evaluate if these two conditions are both satisfied: \\[|x - x_0| = w/2\\] and \\[|y - y_0| = w/2\\]\nwhere - \\(x\\), \\(y\\) are the x, y positions within the grid - \\(x_0\\), \\(y_0\\) are the centre of the square - \\(w\\) - is both the full width and height of the square - \\(| |\\) means the magnitude of the difference\nThis code will show one way to create a mask which contains a square. This will take the most direct approach and evaluate every index in the 2D array one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by creating an array of zeros for our overall grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we can define the parameters we need for the square:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, to check whether a given position is within our mask (the square we are defining), we need to find a way to use our equations above and write them in code.\nWe’ve created a grid of size of 100 x 100 so, as an example, let’s use the position (50, 50) for our grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can build this up to look at every element in the 2D array we have created and check whether this is inside the square (we will leave the value as 0) or outside the square (we will set the value to 1). To do this we can loop through every column and every row and check the result of our conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t need an else block here because the array we have defined already contains zeros. This means if our conditin doesn’t match we don’t need to update the values within the array.\nWe could check where our mask has been set to 1 using the np.where function. For a two-dimensional array like square_mask, this will return two arrays containing the positions of the match - one for the first dimension and one for the second dimension.\nEach pair of values (one in the first array and one the second) represents a 2D position in our array:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can look at this mask using matplotlib and a plotting option called imshow (documentation; example from image gallery):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, the white represents the values in the mask (values of 1) and the black represents the values outside the mask (values of 0).\n\n\nExtended: Leveraging numpy functionality\nAn alternative and more efficient way to do this would be to leverage the properties of numpy arrays and the available numpy functions and indexing.\nWe can start in the same way and create our array of zeros of the right shape\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can represent the pixel position for our x and y dimensions using numbers for 0 to 99 (for x) and 0 to 99 (for y) since our shape is 100 x 100.\nWe can then create a pair of 2D grids, X and Y, to match to the shape of our mask using a function called np.meshgrid(). This stretches our x and y coordinate values to create our 2D numpy arrays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find the positions where our conditions are met within our grid using the np.where() function. From here we can filter our mask using integer array indexing and change these values from 0 to 1 within our mask."

Call your output circular_mask.\nBreak this idea down into the different steps: - Start by creating an array - how could you create an array of the right shape? - How would you turn the equation above into code? - How would you evaluate one (x, y) position to start with? - How do you move on to evaluate every position? - …\nImportant note: For numpy remember that the axes are opposite to what you would expect for an x-y grid - they store data as row-major meaning you access the row as the first index (y) and the column as the second index (x). This means position arr[1, 0] would be at position (0, 1) in x, y co-ordinates rather than (1, 0) as you may expect.\nWhen completed, you can use the plotting code below to show your mask.

Assuming that we start with no money at the beginning, and that the seed of teh default random number generator is seed=1234, how much money do we have at every succesive step?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Window: - Riddle: Write a function that takes a 1D NumPy array and a window size as input, and returns a 2D array where each row is a sliding window of the input array of a given size. - For example, a 1d array with a rolling window of size 3: rolling_window([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) -&gt; [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]\nHint: you can use list comprehension and convert the final list to an array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct of elements: - Riddle: The geometric mean of a number of observations \\(x_1, x_2,\\dots, x_n\\) is defined as \\(M = \\sqrt{x_1\\times x_2\\times \\dots x_n }\\). Define a custom function to calculate the geometric mean. - Example: geometric_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) -&gt; 10.954451150103322\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectorised calculations and visualisation: - Riddle: Draw 100 thousand points uniformly distributed inside a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0). Plot them using scatter() from matplotlib according to their radial coordinate: - use the hexadecimal colour \"#76d6ff\" for points at a distance below 0.5 from the origin$. - use the hexadecimal colour \"ffe701\" for points furtehr away.\nHint1: disk point picking is not trivial: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiskPointPicking.html\nHint2: For matplotlib’s plot, use the pixel style ',', and remmber to set the axis to be in the same units (\"equal\")"

You’ll have many opportunities to revisit the other concepts later in the course, so focus on building confidence with the Beginner material before tackling more advanced work.\n\n\nOption 1: Beginner\nIf you have not spent much time coding in Python prior to taking this course, today you should work through the If Statements notebook linked below:\n\nBeginner: If Statements\n\nThis notebook will talk you through the basics of the if statement. Please read through the text carefully and attempt all exercises!\n\n\nOption 2: Intermediate\nThis weeks intermediate notebook should only be taken by those who are very comfortable with the material in the beginner notebook. Please ensure that you are able to complete the exercises in the beginner notebook before attempting this option. The intermediate material for this week is given below:\n\nIntermediate: Match Statements\n\nThis notebook will guide you through the recently introduced Match statement, which can serve as a convenient alternative to an if-elif statement in many settings. Ensure you read through the text and attempt all exercises.\n\n\nOption 3: Advanced\nIf you are an experienced programmer with a strong grasp of Python, begin by reviewing the exercises in the notebooks below to ensure you are fully comfortable with the material:\n\nBeginner: If Statements\n\nIntermediate: Match Statements\n\nOnce you are confident in your understanding, move on to the following notebook:\n\nAdvanced: Conditional Expressions and Lazy Evaluation\n\nThis notebook will talk you through some of the more complex nuances to boolean logic in Python, including lazy evaluation and in-line conditional evaluation. Please attempt this only if you have spent a lot of time developing code in Python already.",

    "section": "Beginner: If Statements",
    "text": "Beginner: If Statements\nQuestion 1: The answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question aims to give students their first practice with if statements. If a student is struggling, check in with them regularly and recap strings and the len() function as needed.\n\nQuestion 2: The code for this question is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Please be mindful that some students may not be familiar with the pH scale, either because they have not studied Chemistry recently or because they learned it using different terms or acronyms. Before explaining the code, check that they understand the context - they might not say anything if they are confused.\n\nQuestion 3: The problem with this code is that the boolean for the if evaluates as True when the temperature exceeds 100, so the elif is never executed. A simple solution would be to switch the order of the clauses like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The students have been given a similar example, where the solution is to reorder the clauses, in the Worked Example: Determining a Leap Year section. If students are struggling with this question, please suggest they re-read this section before providing them with the answer.\n\nQuestion 4: The code for this question is below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Many students will not immediately think to add up the days in each month in the manner the above code has. Because of the unfamiliar logic, be ready to guide them step by step and ‘’hold their hands’’ a bit more than usual for this question.\n\nQuestion 5: One potential solution to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Many students may struggle here because they have forgotten, or never fully grasped, the % operator. Make sure they understand this operator before giving the answer, explaining it in terms of modular/“clock” arithmetic if necessary.\n\nQuestion 6: An answer to this question is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Last year, many students really struggled with unit conversions. Check they are doing distance_km / 1.60934 instead of distance_km*1.60934.\n\nQuestion 7: A solution to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7: This question may feel daunting to students at first. In reality, the solution only requires adding the first clause (year % 400 == 0). One way to help is to have students test a few example years on paper before coding so the logic becomes clearer. Only encourage them to start coding once you feel they have a strong conceptual grasp of the problem.\n\nQuestion 8: The pass statement is a placeholder which effectively does nothing. If it were not there, we would have a SyntaxError as the if statement must contain code.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question has two purposes. First, it introduces students to the pass statement, which they will need later in the course. Second, and more importantly, it encourages them to practice using documentation and independent research. Prompt students to look up the answer online rather than giving it to them directly.\n\nQuestion 9: An answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This is a classic introduction to coding task. If student’s are struggling encourage them to search for FizzBuzz exercise python online. They will find lots of good advice which does not instantly give them the answer.\n\nQuestion 10: The desired answer is below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Below is a step-by-step solution to reducing this problem. First, note that we can combine the x &lt; 4, x &lt; 15 and x &gt; 30 cases to get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, note that the final elif should never be evaluated as if z &lt; -1 then z &lt; 0, so the if is executed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now combine the innermost if and else as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, note that the z &gt; 20 can’t ever be evaluated True, as if we are inside the outer if then z &lt; 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now combine the inner if and elif:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy combining the outer if and inner statements, we now get the result."

    "text": "Intermediate: Match Statements\nQuestion 1: The answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question aims to give the students pratice with the match statement. Before offering help, it might be worth checking that they understand the context for this question. Before offering help, check that they understand the context: less mathematical students, or non-native speakers, may not feel confident with terms like “Cartesian plane” or “quadrant.”\n\nQuestion 2: The solution to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Because this example looks very similar when written with if statements, students may wonder what the point of match is. Point them to the section Converting Long elif Statements to match, which provides a more compelling example and highlights the advantages of match in certain situations.\n\nQuestion 3: A model answer is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: A common mistake here is confusing operators with their string forms - for example, writing \"*\" instead of *, or the reverse.\n\nQuestion 4: An example solution is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: See the notes on Beginner Question 6 about unit conversion. In this question, some students may try to code every possible pair of conversions separately (e.g. GBP -&gt; USD, GBP -&gt; EUR, … , EUR -&gt; JPY). Discourage this, as it leads to unnecessary repetition (especially if we wanted to add more currency units!). Instead, hint at the approach shown above: convert everything via a common unit, requiring only two conversions.\n\nQuestion 5: Below is a solution to this exercise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Some students may skip the note directing them to review tuples in the intermediate Week 1 material. Before offering help, check that they understand what a tuple is. If they do not, redirect them back to that material."

    "text": "Advanced: Conditional Expressions and Lazy Evaluation\nQuestion 1: An answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The logic in this question is very similar to the absolute value example in the Conditional Expressions section. If students are unsure what to do here, begin by referring them back to this example.\n\nQuestion 2: The answers to this question, alongside commented code are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Explanations of the behaviour are given below:\n\nThe first statement gives a division by zero error because the left-hand side is True, so Python must also evaluate the right-hand side to determine the result of the and.\nThe second statement does not throw an error: since the left-hand side is False, Python stops there and assigns False directly to my_variable without checking the right-hand side.\nThe third statement avoids the error for the same reason as the second. Wrapping the code in str() means my_variable is assigned the string value \"False\" instead of the boolean value False.\nThe fourth case again causes a division by zero error. This is because str(False) is the string \"False\", which is a truthy value in Python (the only Falsy string is the empty string \"\"). Since it is not False, Python must evaluate the second argument 1/0, which triggers the error.\n\n\nQuestion 3: When Python evaluates an and expression, it checks the left-hand side first.\n\nIf my_boolean is True, the right-hand side (print(...)) must also be evaluated, so the message is printed.\nIf my_boolean is False, Python stops immediately, as it knows the and must be False, and the right-hand side is never run - so nothing is printed.\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: If students are struggling with this question, first refer them to the text in the Lazy Evaluation section. This section offers a similar explanation to the above text.\n\nQuestion 4: An answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question may be challenging for students who are still new to Boolean logic. Encourage them to first rewrite the statements in plain English before attempting to code, drawing clear links between the and, or, and not operators and their plain-English meanings.\n\nQuestion 5: The rule for evaluating x or y is:\n\nIf x is Truthy, return x.\nIf x is Falsy, return y.\n\nThis is the mirror image of how and works. Some example code is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The reasoning behind the answer is as follows. Suppose x and y are Boolean values and we want to evaluate x or y. We would do the following\n\nFirst check x. If x is True, then the whole or expression is True and there is no need to check y. In this case, we return x.\nIf x is False, then we must check y. If y is True, the whole expression is True; otherwise, it is False. In either case, the result is the truth value of y, so we return y.\n\nGeneralising from Booleans, we replace True with Truthy and False with Falsy, giving the final rule:\n\nIf x is Truthy, return x.\n\nIf x is Falsy, return y."

    "section": "What is a match Statement?",
    "text": "What is a match Statement?\nThe match statement is a relatively new addition to Python, having been added in Python 3.10 in 2021. This statement can be used to compare the value of a variable to different many different patterns. When it finds a match, the code inside the corresponding case block runs.\nThis is similar to using lots of if/elif checks, but can be cleaner and easier to read.\nHere’s a simple example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code tells us what to do if we see a specific color at a traffic light. In the code, we provide the color we have seen as a string (which has been set to \"red\" in the above) and the match statement will consider a number of cases one at a time, checking whether the color variable matches the value for that case. When it finds a match, it runs the code inside that case block.\nNote that in the final case we have an underscore, _. This simply means “match anything that hasn’t already matched.” You can think of it like the else at the end of an if/elif statement. It serves as a “catch-all” to deal with any unexpected or unhandled values.\n\nTest your understanding: How might you modify the above code to allow case-sensitive examples such as color=\"ReD\" or color=\"GreEn\"? Hint: recall the lower() function from the beginner notebook in Week 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, you may want several different inputs to trigger the same response. In such cases, instead of writing out separate case blocks for each value, we can group them together inside a single case using the pipe symbol, |. This lets us list several alternatives side by side, and if the variable matches any one of them, that case is chosen.\nFor example, in the below code we group “Saturday” and “Sunday” together, since both are weekend days:",

    "text": "Converting Long elif Statements to match\nOne of the biggest advantages of the match statement is how cleanly it handles data with complex structures.\nSuppose we want to represent different 3D solids using dictionaries. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are not yet comfortable with dictionaries, please review the week 1 intermediate notebook on collections. There you will find introductory material on the dict data type.\n\nHere, solid_data describes a cylinder with a given radius and height. We might also store information for other solids:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach solid requires different keys: a sphere has only a radius, a rectangular prism has width, height, and depth, while a cylinder needs both radius and height.\nNow imagine we want to compute the volume automatically, regardless of which solid is described. A natural first attempt is a long chain of if-elif-else statements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this works, it quickly becomes unwieldy. Each branch requires lots of repetition (.get(), nested ifs), and adding new shapes means adding even more clutter.\nThe match statement for this task is much simpler. This is in part due to some useful syntax; we can unpack the values inside the dictionary immediately, without using the .get() function as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is much cleaner:\n\nNo need for repeated .get() calls\nNo nested if checks\nSimple, readable case syntax\n\nAnd adding a new solid is now as simple as writing one more two-line case.",

Use a match statement to apply the correct operation and display the result.\nFor example, if operator = \"*\", the program should calculate and store my_result = a * b. If the operator is not one of the four listed above, your code should print \"Invalid operator\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: The variable account stores a tuple (balance, currency), where balance is the amount of money a user has and currency is the unit of that balance. The unit will be one of \"USD\", \"EUR\", \"GBP\", or \"JPY\". Your job is to convert this balance into another currency, stored in the variable target_currency (again, one of the four listed above).\nWrite a Python program using match statements to:\n\nConvert account into the requested target_currency using the exchange rates provided below.\n\nPrint the resulting balance, formatted with the correct symbol:\n\n\"USD\" → \"$\"\n\n\"EUR\" → \"€\"\n\n\"GBP\" → \"£\"\n\n\"JPY\" → \"¥\"\n\n\nIf either currency (from account) or target_currency is not one of the four supported codes, print \"Unsupported currency\".\nNote: You will have to look up the current exchange rates online (you need only use three significant figures for the conversion).\nHint: You may wish to use two match statements for this task; one converting to a single currency, say GBP, and another converting from GBP to the desired output currency.\nIf you are unsure what a Tuple is, please revisit the week 01 intermediate notebook on collections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5: In digital images, colors are represented using RGB values. An RGB value is a 3-tuple (r, g, b) that gives the intensity of the red, green, and blue components of a color, each ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(255\\).

    "text": "Background\n\nThe Periodic Table\nIn your previous studies, you have likely encountered the periodic table of elements. In this challenge, you will use the periodic table to explore and derive various properties of isotopes.\n\nThe periodic table organizes chemical elements (substances whose atoms contain a fixed number of protons) into rows (periods) and columns (groups). In addition to ordering the elements, the periodic table is also a powerful tool for categorization. It groups together elements that share similar properties.\nFor instance, in the image above, the colors highlight the following categories of elements:\n\n\nAlkali metals: very reactive metals that readily form compounds with nonmetals.\n\n\nAlkaline earth metals: reactive metals that form basic solutions when they react with water.\n\n\nLanthanides: rare earth elements often used in magnets and electronics.\n\n\nActinides: heavy elements, many of which are radioactive.\n\n\nTransition metals: versatile metals widely used in alloys and catalysts.\n\n\nPost-transition metals: softer metals with lower melting points than transition metals.\n\n\nMetalloids: elements with properties of both metals and nonmetals.\n\n\nHalogens and other nonmetals: generally poor conductors; many are gases or brittle solids, and halogens in particular are very reactive.\n\n\nNoble gases: very stable gases that rarely react with other elements.\n\n\nBy convention, we assume that all lathanides have period 6 and group 3, and all actinides have period 7 and group 3 (see periodic table above).\nIn each box of the periodic table, you can see the name, chemical symbol, and category of the element. The atomic number is shown in the top left. This tells you how many protons are in the nucleus of the atom, and it also determines the element’s position in the table. An atom has the same number of protons and electrons, so the atomic number also represents the number of electrons in the atom. The relative atomic mass is shown in the top right. This value represents the average mass of all the naturally occurring isotopes of that element, taking into account how common each isotope is.\nFor example, the box for carbon (C) shows the atomic number 6 in the top left, which means every carbon atom has 6 protons. In the top right, the relative atomic mass is shown as about 12.01, reflecting the natural mixture of mostly carbon-12 and a small amount of carbon-13.\n\n\nIsotopes\nAs noted above, not all of the atoms of the same element have the same mass. This is because, although atoms of the same element must have, by definition, the same number of protons, they can have different numbers of neutrons. An atom with a fixed number of neutrons is known as an isotope and we usually denote isotopes by the element name followed by the mass number: that is, the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom. For instance, carbon-12 is an isotope of carbon with a mass number of 12. You might also see this written as \\(^{12}C\\) or \\(^{12}_6C\\), if we want to highlight that the atom possesses \\(6\\) protons.",

This includes some of the data displayed in the periodic table, saved as a dictionary of dictionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Don’t worry if you are unsure what the import and from keywords are doing in the above code. For now, you can think of these as a way of loading in pre-written functions such as the get_periodic_table function. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice and understand these features of Python as the course goes on.\n\nTry running the following commands to see if you can understand how to use this variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Before proceeding, if you are unsure about dictionaries please see the week 1 intermediate notebook for further detail.\n\nFor an arbitrary isotope represented as described above, the challenge is to solve the following tasks.\nNote: If you are not sure how to get started, have a look at the guidance section on this week’s home page.\n\nImportant: For this task, you may only use material covered in the previous 4 week’s classes. To solve the challenge problems, you may use any content from the beginner, intermediate, or advanced notebooks. However, every challenge can be completed using only the material in the beginner notebooks, so don’t worry if you haven’t looked at the others. The tasks are designed to be accessible to everyone!\n\n\nTask 1: Verifying Elements\nWrite a function that takes two inputs; a string representing an isotope and the periodic_table dictionary. The function should verify whether the chemical symbol in the isotope string corresponds to a valid element in the periodic table and print a message indicating the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You can convert the keys in dictionary to a list using list(dict_name.keys()).\n\n\nTask 2: Verifying the Atomic Number\nWrite a function that takes two inputs; a string representing an isotope and the periodic_table dictionary. The function must check whether the number of protons, if provided, matches that in the periodic table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Counting Electrons, Protons and Neutrons\nUpdate your code from Task 2 so that, unless an incorrect number of protons is provided, it prints the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the isotope. Make sure your code outputs these values even if the number of protons is not explicitly included in the isotope string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Group and Period\nWrite a function that takes two inputs; a string representing an isotope and the periodic_table dictionary. The function must print the group and period of the element in the periodic table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Isotope Names\nWrite a function which return a string representing the name of the isotope. For instance, 12_C should return \"Carbon-12\". Note that \\(^1H\\),\\(^2H\\) and \\(^3H\\) do not follow the standard convention and are usually referred to as \"Hydrogen\", \"Deuterium\" and \"Tritium\" rather than \"Hydrogen-1\", \"Hydrogen-2\" and \"Hydrogen-3\", respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6: Categorizing Isotopes\nWrite a function which returns a string representing the category the isotope belongs to (e.g. \"Alkali Metals\", \"Actinides\",…, etc).",

The reason that we do not ask for this is that the robot could be in a dead-end (e.g. there is a wall left, right and ahead). If we ask the students to prevent the robot from turning whenever it senses a wall, then in a dead-end the robot will get stuck and the while loop will execute indefinitely. If you see students with this issue, remind them that the question does not ask them to modify the turning behaviour of the robot - it only asks them to modify the call to robot.move().\n\nTask 3: End of the Road. The below code provides a solution to this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Some general advice for this question: - Make sure students have their browser zoomed far enough out so that they can see both the Robot Console and the maze at the same time. - If they haven’t already, advise students to set the robot delay so that the robot moves slowly (e.g. robot.delay = 2). This will allow them to verify that what the robot is printing the correct response in real time. - There are many ways to approach this task; however, one of the most convenient is to count the number of walls around the robot, as counting the wall allows you to handle the dead-end, single-wall and unbordered-square cases immediately. - When students are trying to count the number of walls, let them first write out the robot.sense(\"AHEAD\"), robot.sense(\"LEFT\"),… etc calls one-at-a-time. Once they have done this, point out the repetitive nature of the code to them, and explain why this code might be cleaner using a loop. - When distinguishing between corners and corridors it is easier to list the situations in which you are in a corridor (there is a wall to the left and right, or there is a wall behind and ahead) then the situations where you are in a corner (there is a wall ahead and left, ahead and right, behind and left, behind and right).\n\nTask 4: Turning Back. Below is an example solution for this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This challenge is difficult as it will be drawing on many concepts, some of which are relatively new to the students. It is expected that many students will struggle with (i) identifying the explored and unexplored squares and (ii) choosing randomly from these directions. Feel free to offer more guidance/hold-the-hands of those students that are struggling on this question and stress that it is okay to be struggling at this level. Solving this question should be satisfying, as the robot will move towards the target in a much more directed fashion than in the previous questions.\n\nTask 5: Final Challenge. There are plenty of solutions to this task. Here is just one example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Although there are lots of possible algorithms students could use here, the most sensible choice, both in terms of efficiency and implementability, given the setup we have, is the “Hand on Wall Rule”. Encourage students who are unsure to try this rule; compared to part 4 of this challenge, this algorithm is surprisingly easy to implement."

Below is an example solution for part (1) of the Physics challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This is the hardest part of this challenge and it is expected that many of the students will struggle at first. Encourage students to try and break down this question into parts. e.g. useful advice could inclue: - Make sure you can describe the experiment/context in words before starting to code. - Start by considering a string for a single trial. - Write out some string examples on paper first. Make sure you understand the rules for replacing errors before starting to code. - If necessary, try working with some smaller example strings first, e.g. write out test_string = 'ooexx'; test_string2 = 'ooxxe'; test_string3 = 'oeexx' and try to “clean” these one by one.\nAlso, it is possible for students to get to this point in the course without having worked with dictionaries and lists very much. If a student seems unsure about dictionaries and lists please refer them to the week 1 and week 3 intermediate notebooks for further reading.\n\nTask 2: Detect When Each Bar Begins to Block the Beam. Solution code for part (1) of the Physics challenge is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: It is expected that a large stumbling block for students will be figuring out how they are going to approach the question and, in particular, how they plan to store the results of their computations. Encourage them to think about how carefully about how many time values they will have to store before they start to code:\n\nIn an invidiual trial, they will have to record the time in seconds every time a bar blocks the sensor. This means they will have one time recorded per bar.\nThe dataset has been deliberately constructed so that different trials use a different number of bars. This is mentioned in the section titled “The Data”.\nSo for each trial, we have one time per bar and the number of bars may vary between trials.\n\nBy first discussing the above, it should be easier to motivate potential approaches to storing the time values. For instance, in the above code, a dictionary of lists is used. This approach can be motivated by noting that we have many time values per trial, so it seems reasonable to store these as a list, and then noting that we wish to keep track of which trial each list of times came from, hence the dictionary.\n\nTask 3: Estimate Average Velocities. Example code for this question is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Compared to the previous, this question is much simpler. However, it is expected that many students may fail to notice that the number of recorded velocities (which are computed as finite differences in distance) will be one less than the number of recorded times (that is, in the above it should be the case that len(times_data)==len(velo_list)+1). If students are experiencing index out of bounds errors, it is worth checking their logic here and writing out on paper an example illustrating how \\(n\\) datapoints leads to \\(n-1\\) finite differences. E.g.\n\\[(2,4,5) \\rightarrow (4-2,5-4)=(2,1)\\]\n\nTask 4: Estimate Accelerations. An answer to this question is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: If students have got this far they are likely to complete this question and the next successfully. That said, if reading too fast, some students may confuse \\(\\tau_k\\) and \\(t_k\\). If students are getting any strange values in their computation, it may be worth checking they have this notation correct.\n\nTask 5: Estimate \\(g\\). The below code computes the within-trial averages of the acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code averages acceleration across trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The final value output should be 9.825957197907218 (up to python rounding errors). If a student has something wildly different to this, they have likely made a mistake somewhere."

Here is an example solution to this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Students will still be building confidence with dictionaries at this point. Try to provide simple examples where possible to help them get to grips with the idea of keys and values.\n\nTask 2: Verifying the Atomic Number. Here is an example answer to task 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Students who skim the text may miss that the number of protons is the atomic number in the periodic table. If they ask about this, encourage them to look back through the text for clarification.\n\nTask 3: Counting Electrons, Protons and Neutrons. Here is some example code for task 3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Students who skim the text may miss the fact that the number of protons is the same as the number of electrons.

Example code for this task is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is laborious but not difficult once you understand the logic. The basic idea is to break the table down into chunks for which the atomic number can be used to predict the group and period. For instance, along the fourth row, the period is 4 and the group is num_protons - 18. If students are struggling with this question, encourage them to narrow their focus to a smaller segment of the table and work with that.\n\nTask 5: Isotope Names. An example solution for this is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Compared to the previous questions, this is a little easier. Try not to give too much direct assistance on this question, as most students should be able to complete it. The main errors expected on this question are TypeErrors due to students forgetting to cast the string values to integers.\n\nTask 6: Categorizing Isotopes. Here is an example solution to this task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is much easier if you use the group and period computed in task 4. If students are stuck, encourage them to think about which of the previous tasks might help them here, and highlight that they can use the functions they have already written. To understand the logic of the solution, it helps to draw out a rough periodic table on paper and shade each section covered by successive clauses of the if statement."

    "section": "Tutorial: The Robot Maze",
    "text": "Tutorial: The Robot Maze\nToday, you will be programming a robot to navigate a small maze. To get started, run the code box below. This will load in the RobotMaze function which we will be working with today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Robot Maze\nThe RobotMaze function will create a new randomly generated maze with a robot inside it. Try running the below code to see what this looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down what we can see here. The maze contains:\n\nWhite Squares: Open spaces, which the robot has not yet visited.\nBlack squares: Walls. The robot cannot walk into these.\nGrey squares: These are open spaces that the robot has visited previously.\nA red circle with a white arrow: This is the robot. The arrow tells us which way it is facing.\nA green circle with a T: This is the target. This is where the robot must move to.\n\nAt the top of the maze, we see the title Robot Maze - Run #1. Here, the number #1 refers to the number of times we have attempted to solve the maze.\nAt the bottom of the maze, we see the Robot Console. This is a handy message box, which we shall use to display messages from the robot throughout this task.\n\n\nMoving the Robot\nHere are some instructions you can give the robot:\n\nrobot.move(): Running this will cause the robot to take one step forward in the direction it is currently facing.\nrobot.turn(): This function takes a string as input. It will turn the robot to the left if the string is \"LEFT\", right if the string is \"RIGHT\", behind if the string is \"BEHIND\" and ahead if the string is \"AHEAD\". The robot always turns relative to the direction it is currently facing (that is, where the white arrow is pointing).\n\nRun the below code to see how this works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the robot bumps into a wall, it will not move forward. Instead, it will print a message to the Robot Console telling you it has bumped into a wall.\n\nIf the robot is moving too fast or slow, you can change the speed at which it moves using the robot.delay parameter. For instance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Due to limitations on how Jupyter notebooks are rendered, there is a limit to how fast the robot can move. That is, setting robot.delay to less than around 0.1 might not result in much of a speedup.\n\n\n\nResetting and Saving the Maze\nIf you want to reset the maze, and send the robot back to the start, you can use the robot.reset() command like so. Notice that the title will now say Robot Maze - Run #2, but the Robot Console will keep the robot’s message history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you run the robot = RobotMaze(), a new random maze is generated. Sometimes you might want to save a particular maze to come back to later. You can do this by running robot.get_maze_id(). For instance, to save the maze you have above, you can run the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then load the same maze again later on using my_maze_id. Try commenting out and uncommenting the below lines of code to test your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: You can clear the output of a cell in a Jupyter notebook by going to Cell on the toolbar, then Current Outputs and Clear.\n\n\nRecall: You can interrupt a cell that is running in Jupyter by pressing the stop button on the toolbar (which looks like a square) or by clicking Kernel and then Interrupt.\n\n\n\nAims and Limits\nYour aim in this challenge to write code that moves the robot to the target. However, there is a catch - the robot only has a finite amount of fuel!\nThe robot begins with 1000 units of fuel. Each call to robot.move() and robot.turn() costs one unit of fuel. Once the robot has no fuel left, it will not be able to move.\nHere are some functions you can use to check on the robot’s status:\n\nrobot.at_target(): This will return True if the robot is on the target square and False otherwise.\nrobot.check_fuel(): This will tell you how much fuel the robot has left. The amount will be returned as an integer between 0 and 1000.\nrobot.print(): This will print a message to the robot console.\n\nThe below code uses the above commands. See if you can understand what it is doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the robot is equipped with a sensor that can detect what type of square is in a given direction.\nTo use the sensor, call the robot.sense() function with one of the following inputs: \"AHEAD\", \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", or \"BEHIND\". The function returns a string describing the square in that direction, returning either \"WALL\", \"EMPTY\", or \"BEEN_THERE\" if the robot has already visited it.\nHave a look at the below code for an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Using the sensor does not require fuel! That is, it may be better to sense before you move…"

In the below code box, you will see there is a function named my_controller. See if you can determine what this controller does before reading ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nice thing about writing our commands for the robot inside a function is that we can now run the entire set of instructions simply by calling the function, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry updating the my_controller function so that the robot first checks for a wall in front of it before attempting to move forward. If a wall is detected, the robot should stay in place and not move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: End of the Road\nContinuing with the my_controller function, modify your code to identify if the robot is:\n\nAt a dead-end (a square surrounded by three walls),\nAt a corner (a square bordering two walls whose corners touch),\nIn a corridor (a square with two walls bordering it on opposing sides),\nNext to a single wall (a square with only one wall bordering it),\nOn an unbordered square (a square sharing no edges with a wall).\n\nUse the robot.print() function to print a message to the console stating which type of square the robot is on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Turning Back\nWrite your own controller function which does the following: - Senses the squares around the robot. - If there at least one of the surrounding squares is \"EMPTY\", the robot should choose an \"EMPTY\" square at random and move to it. - If there are no \"EMPTY\" squares, the robot should choose at random from the \"BEEN_THERE\" squares surrounding it and move to the chosen square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Final Challenge\nIt is now up to you!\nBy doing your own research on maze solving algorithms, choose a method to solve the maze and try writing it up as a controller function. Can you solve the maze faster than the my_controller robot, or your solution to Task 4?\nGood luck!"

You’ll have many opportunities to revisit the other concepts later in the course, so focus on building confidence with the Beginner material before tackling more advanced work.\n\n\nOption 1: Beginner\nIf you are not very familiar with functions in Python, or would like some practice, today you should work through the Defining Functions notebook below:\n\nBeginner: Defining Functions\n\nThis notebook introduces what functions are and shows you how to create them in Python. Be sure to read the explanations carefully and try each exercise along the way!\n\n\nOption 2: Intermediate\nThis week’s intermediate notebook is intended only for those who are already confident with the material in the beginner notebook. lease ensure that you are able to complete the exercises in the beginner notebook before attempting this option. The intermediate material for this week is given below:\n\nIntermediate: Flexible Inputs and Outputs\n\nThis notebook will build on your understanding of functions by introducing positional-only and keyword-only arguments, the use of arbitrary arguments, functions with multiple return values, and the concept of a recursive function.\n\n\nOption 3: Advanced\nIf you already have solid experience with Python programming, start by reviewing the exercises in the following notebooks to confirm that you’re fully comfortable with the fundamentals:\n\nBeginner: Defining Functions\n\nIntermediate: Flexible Inputs and Outputs\n\nOnce you feel confident with these concepts, proceed to the advanced material:\n\nAdvanced: Lambda Functions and Functional Programming\n\nIn this notebook, you’ll be introduced to the lambda operator and the idea of a higher-order function - a function that takes other functions as input. You will then explore three widely used higher-order functions: map, filter, and reduce. These functions are especially useful when it comes to writing clear and concise code.",

In the second line, they are assigned according to the keyword/variable names given, so that x=4 and y=3. In the third line, x takes the default value of 2 whilst y=4. In the fourth line, both default values x=2 and y=1 are used. And in the final line, y takes the default value of 1 while x=3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to get students thinking about how inputs are entered into functions. Please try to prevent students from running the code before they have attempted to answer the question, as the goal is for them to reason it out first.\n\nQuestion 2: An answer to this question is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: A useful sanity check for this question is to ask students whether their function works correctly on strings that include punctuation. An easy, and subtle, mistake to make here is to write if ch == ch.upper(): instead of if ch != ch.lower():. The difference matters because for non-alphabetic characters (like punctuation), ch.upper() and ch.lower() are both equal to ch itself.\n\nQuestion 3: The functions for this question are given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Please be mindful that many students may not have studied Physics for several years, so might be uncomfortable with the terms kinetic energy and potential energy. Make sure the student is comfortable with the context of the question before moving into the coding explanation.\n\nQuestion 4: A sample answer for this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: For many students, this may be their first exposure to the import and from keywords, as well as the os package. They also won’t have encountered plotting yet. If students ask about these topics, you’re welcome to give a brief explanation if you like, but it’s also fine to tell them that these will be covered in detail later in the course if it is easier.\n\nQuestion 5: The time() function gives the number of seconds passed since epoch (the point where time begins, e.g. January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC is epoch on unix systems). Some suggested code to show students for this question is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: See notes on Question 4.\n\nQuestion 6: An example answer for this question is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: It is expected that many students will have forgotten the split function from week 1. Please encourage them to look up documentation where possible, rather than giving the answer directly.\n\nQuestion 7: If you write a function which redefines a global variable, then inside the function, Python makes a new local variable x when you assign x = 20. That local version is separate from the global version x = 10. So inside you see 20, and outside you still see 10.\n\nDemonstrator Advice: One way of explaining what is going on here is to show students the following code, where we have replaced the calls to x outside the function with x_outer and the code inside the function with x_inner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this code it is pretty easy to predict what will be printed. Because the variables have different names, there is no ambiguity. Behind the scenes, this renaming is exactly what Python is doing when you redefine a global variable inside a function.\nHowever, it must be stressed that this will only happen when you redefine the variable (e.g. write x=...) somewhere inside the function. For instance, if we comment out the x=20 line from the original code, then the function will treat x as though it is x_outer, not x_inner!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8: Here is an example answer for this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is hard, and will be fairly challenging for most students. Please feel free to give them a bit more guidance when answering this one - one good place to start might be to have them compute the \\(n^{th}\\) Fibonnaci number from the \\((n-1)^{th}\\) and \\((n-2)^{th}\\) Fibonacci numbers.\nIt probably isn’t a good idea to discuss code efficiency/making the code faster at this stage of the course. This question will already pose a large conceptual challenge for many students, and showing them how to rewrite the code to improve it further might feel like an extra layer of complexity. (The above code certainly isn’t the most efficient!).\n\nQuestion 9: Example code for this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is difficult and will need more guidance for many students. It is expected that many students will not think to use the str constructor to convert their numerical data into a string and many will not think to loop through the characters of string, treating it as an iterator (e.g. many may not think to write code of the form for character in my_string:). Beyond these syntax hints, try to encourage students who are struggling to first write how they would perform the computation by hand on paper, before they start coding. This is often a good starting point for explaining the logic and working out what they understand of the question.\n\nQuestion 10: Code for this question can be found below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question should be a little easier than the previous, but please do check that students are actually using the function from the previous question, rather than rewriting the code from scratch, or copy-pasting large chunks."

Please encourage students to attempt the question before running the code to check their answer. If students are struggling with the conceptual aspects of this question, please do try to refer back to the notebook section where possible.\nWhen discussing the answers to this question, it is worth highlighting that, when we pass no arguments to *args and **kwargs, this is the same as passing in an empty list, (), or empty dictionary, {}, rather than passing no variables at all. This is a good discussion point - asking students why they think this is can help you to check their understanding of *args and **kwargs.\n\nQuestion 2: An example answer for this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is fairly straightforward. We are not expecting answers that are any more complex/streamlined than the above (although students are certainly welcome to try). Given the week 2 intermediate notebook, some students may use a match statement instead of an if-elif-else. This is perfectly fine as well.\n\nQuestion 3: The expected output for this question is:\nHere is another print statement.\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\nHere is a print statement.\n----------------------------\nHere is a print statement.\n----------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is mainly to test the students logic and understanding of how Python handles functions with multiple return statements. A good case to focus on is the case a==0. Useful questions to ask students here include:\n- Why do you think nothing is printed when a==0? - Will print('Here is another print statement.') be printed when a==0? - Will 0 or -1 be returned when a==0?\n\nQuestion 4: The code returns True if the integer is prime and False otherwise. The answers to the listed questions are as follows:\n\nWhat values of i will the loop check?\n\nIt will check all values between 2 and my_integer-1, inclusive. Given no prior knowledge, these are the values which could possibly be factors of my_integer.\n\nWhat does the expression my_integer % i mean?\n\nThis is the modulo operator, which we met in the Week 1 Beginner notebook. It gives the remainder obtained from dividing my_integer by i. If this expression equals zero, then my_integer is divisible by i (i.e. i is a factor of my_integer).\n\nUnder what condition does the function return False?\n\nThe function returns False whenever we find an integer i (lying between 2 and my_integer-1) that is a factor of my_integer. In other words, it returns False when my_integer has a factor, that is when my_integer is not prime.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to get students thinking about how return statements can be used to end loops prematurely, a bit like a break statement. They will have met the break statement in the Week 3 intermediate notebook, but might not realise the connection here. When explaining the logic of this question, feel free to reference break statements to highlight the similarity, but make sure to point out that return not only stops the loop but also exits the entire function immediately.\nThis question is also a good opportunity to get students to think about debugging code. It is expected that, when asked to work out what the code is doing, many students will try to dissect the code conceptually from first principles without running it. If you see students attempting to do this and struggling, encourage them to adopt a more pratical approach - e.g. suggest that they run the function for several different values of my_integer and see if they can guess the function’s behaviour from the output.\n\nQuestion 5: The another_mystery_function function takes in a string and reverses the order of the letters. The same thing can be done using, for example, the below loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Recursive functions can be difficult to explain on the spot. If a student asks for help, then by all means, feel free to go through step-by-step explaining what the code is doing if you feel you are able. However, if you do not feel confident doing this, you can instead encourage the student to identify the code’s function by looking at various inputs and outputs and “spotting the pattern”. The latter is still a good exercise in debugging code and a worthwhile use of the student’s time."

    "text": "Advanced: Lambda Functions and Functional Programming\nQuestion 1: An answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: It might be useful to break this question down into the following steps: 1. Write a (normal) function which checks if a string has between three and eight characters. If it does, the function should return True, otherwise it should return False. 1. Try to condense this function to only take up a few lines. 1. Convert this function to a lambda function. 1. Insert this lambda function into a filter expression.\nNote it is easy to forget that the end result must be converted back to a list - it is very likely that at least some students will forget to do this and be confused by the object returned by the filter function.\n\nQuestion 2: Example code for this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: As with Question 1, it might be useful to break this question down into the following steps: 1. Write a (normal) function which returns the value of \"name\" from a dictionary. 1. Convert this function to a lambda function. 1. Insert this lambda function into a map expression.\nAgain, it is easy to forget that the end result must be converted back to a list - it is very likely that at least some students will forget to do this and be confused by the object returned by the map function.\n\nQuestion 3: An example answer is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to give students practice writing higher-order functions and treating functions themselves as objects. Student’s will likely need reminding that they can write ^ for exclusive or, as they have only briefly seen this operation in the week 1 beginner notebook. It is perfectly fine, and also a good exercise, to have them instead write out f(x) ^ g(x) as (f(x) and not g(x)) or (g(x) and not f(x)) (it may also help to draw a Venn diagram for students who want to adopt this approach).\n\nQuestion 4: The reduce expression here is performing function composition and the new function is being evaluated with 5 as input. In other words, if the expression is given a list of function \\([f_1,...,f_n]\\) then the output will be \\((f_1 \\circ f_2 \\circ ... \\circ f_n)(5)=f_1(f_2(...f_n(5)...))\\).\n\nDemonstrator Notes: For less mathematical students, avoid the phrase “composition”. Instead, explain the idea in plain English. For example: “First, take the last function in the list and run it with the input 5. Then take the result you get and plug it into the second-to-last function. Keep going like this, working backwards through the list.”\n\nQuestion 5: This function computes the maximum value in a list. Behind the scenes, it is doing the following:\n\nIt first takes the first two elements, 3 and 1, and applies the lambda function which returns the maximum of the two.\nNext, it takes the result of the first step, in this case 3, and the next element in the list 4. Again it applies the lambda function which returns the maximum of the two.\nIt then repeats this process, each time comparing the current result with the next element of the list, and choosing the maximum of the two, until there are no elements left.\nThe final value produced is the largest value in the list.\n\nAnother way of thinking about it is as doing the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Although it might not seem like it on first viewing, this example is designed to be extremely similar to the example given in the reduce section of the notebook. If students are struggling with this, please direct them to this section first."

    "text": "dicts as iterables.\nThe Beginner notebook for this weeks class introduces the notions of iterators and iterables, and shows how you can iterate over lists and strings. In this notebook, we will start by looking at a slightly more complex example; dictionaries.\nDictionaries (dicts) are also iterable in Python, but what exactly does that mean? When you iterate over a dictionary directly, you get its keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are unfamiliar with the dict datatype, take a look at the intermediate collections notebook for week 1 of this course.\n\nBy default, iterating over a dict gives you its keys. However, you can also access values or key-value pairs using methods like .keys(), .values(), and .items(). Let’s have a look at these, using the above dictionary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at this last example. In this case, the iterable student_grades.items() seems to be giving us two values, name and grade, rather than one. What is happening here?\nLet’s make student_grades.items() into an iterator using the iter keyword and print off it’s items one-by-one using the next keyword (further detail on iter and next can be found in the beginner notebook).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now see what is happening, the items() iterable object is giving us a sequence of tuples and when we write for name, grade in student_grades.items(), Python is treating the first element of each tuple as name and teh second element as grade. This is an example of sequence unpacking and is a bit like how you can write the following for tuples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll see more examples of tuple unpacking in for loops in the next section when we look at the zip and enumerate functions.",

    "section": "enumerate and zip",
    "text": "enumerate and zip\nIn the last section, we saw how unpacking items from a dictionary was an example of sequence unpacking in a for loop. In this section, we’ll explore two more convenient tools that use sequence unpacking: the enumerate and zip functions. To understand why these are useful, let’s start with a motivating example.\nHere we have three lists of equal length and we want to loop over them all at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this works, it’s a bit cumbersome. We’ve we spent several lines just defining variables inside the for loop. This is where the zip function comes in handy. zip takes multiple iterables (like lists) and pairs their elements together, allowing you to iterate over them in a single loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code achieves the same result but is much cleaner. Here, zip(list_a, list_b, list_c) creates an iterable that yields tuples like ('Happy', 'dog', 'runs'), ('Sad', 'cat', 'sleeps'), and so on. We’re then using sequence unpacking inside the for loop to assign each part of the tuple to a, b, and c. This works for any number of lists (as long as they’re iterable), and it automatically stops at the end of the shortest one if they’re not all the same length.\nNow, let’s look at another common situation where sequence unpacking is very useful: when you need both the value from a list and its index (position) during iteration. For example, suppose you have a list of exam scores and want to flag any that are below a passing mark, reporting the student’s position in the list (say, the student_number) in the process. One approach might be to write:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain this is a little cumbersome; we have an extra line of code defining score inside the loop. It would be nice to use sequence unpacking to remove this. This is where we can use the enumerate function, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, enumerate(scores) yields tuples like (0, 85), (1, 92), etc and we unpack them directly into student_number and score in the for loop.\nSummary: - zip lets you loop over several lists at once by pairing their elements into tuples - enumerate gives you both the index and the value while you loop, so you don’t have to count manually",

    "section": "continue, break and pass Statements",
    "text": "continue, break and pass Statements\nIn the last few sections, we explored how you can use sequence unpacking to improve your loops readability. In this section, we’re going to investigate a different set of Python tools, which can also give you finer control and improve readability when it comes to writing loops; these are the continue, break, and pass statements. We’ll now look at each of these in turn.\nLet’s start with continue. The continue statement allows you to skip the rest of the current loop’s code block and immediately jump to the next iteration. For instance, in the below code, when i==2 we skip over the print statement and move to the next iteration of the loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code is equivalent to running:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether or not to use the continue statement often comes down to personal preference. In some cases, however, it can make code more readable by reducing indentation - for example, notice how print(i) is less indented in the version of the above code that uses continue.\nThe break statement is similar to continue - both give you control over the flow of a loop. But while continue lets you skip ahead to the next iteration, break lets you end the whole thing right then and there.\nFor example, the following loop will “break” when i==2 and terminate completely:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis prints only 0 and 1, because as soon as i hits 2, the break kicks in and the loop stops dead. There are no more iterations, and no more printing.\nThis kind of early exit can be very useful when you know you might not need to go through the entire sequence. For instance, imagine you have a list of numbers and you’re just looking for the first duplicate - you don’t care about any others after that. In such a case, you might want to use a break as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, there’s the pass statement. This statement doesn’t change the flow of your loop at all. It’s just there to keep Python happy when you need a statement syntactically but don’t want to do anything yet. Think of it like a sticky note saying “I’ll fill this in later.” For example, the below code will throw an error if we try to run it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if we put a pass inside the loop, then the code will ignore the incomplete body, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a handy statement to know when you are working on large complex coding projects with lots going on!",

It’s a somewhat unusual feature, but can be very useful in specific situations.\nThe else block associated with a for loop is executed if and only if the loop completes normally. In other words, the else is executed if the loop completes it’s iteration without encountering a break statement. If a break statement is executed inside the loop, the else block is skipped.\nHere’s an example to illustrate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the loop completes without finding the number 6, so the else block is executed, printing \"Did not find 6 in the list.\".\nNow, let’s change the list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the loop encounters the number 6 and executes the break statement. As a result, the else block is not executed.\nYou’ll most often see for...else in search scenarios where you need to take action if an item isn’t found. The else block serves as your “search failed” handler, making the code’s logic more explicit and self-contained without requiring additional variables to whether the item was found or not.",

Explain why the code does not work as intended, and then fix the error by changing only one line of code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: You are given a dictionary where the keys are unique, but the values may repeat. Write a for loop that creates a new dictionary by swapping the keys and values from the original dictionary. This means that:\n\nThe new keys should be the old values.\nThe new values should be lists containing all the old keys that had that value.\n\nFor instance, if the original_dict was given by:\noriginal_dict = {\n    'a': 1,\n    'b': 2,\n    'c': 1,\n    'd': 3,\n    'e': 2\n}\nThen your code should output:\ninverted_dict = {\n    1: ['a', 'c'],\n    2: ['b', 'e'],\n    3: ['d']\n}\nIn your solution, you must use sequence unpacking in the for loop (i.e., unpack the key and value directly in the loop header).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5: The following program is supposed to check each day in the list days and print whether it is a weekday or at the weekend. However, something has gone wrong! In the below code the day Monday is skipped entirely. Explain what has gone wrong here and fix the error.",

This week it is time to start scaling up our computation!\nTo begin today, let’s consider a simple coding task. Suppose you are asked to print the first 10 Triangle Numbers. With only what we know so far, the code might look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code is already long and repetitive, but imagine if I’d instead asked you to go up to \\(100\\), or \\(1,000\\)! This task would be impossible!\nLoops give us a way to automate repetition. Instead of writing the same line of code again and again, we’ll learn how to tell Python: “Do this thing repeatedly until I say stop.”\nBy the end of today, you’ll be able to write the same task in just one or two lines of code.",

    "text": "Iterators and Iterables\nSo far we’ve seen several basic data types in Python:\n\nNumeric data types: 3, -10, 4.5\nStrings: \"hello\", \"Python\"\nBooleans: True, False\n\nBut often, we want to work with more than one piece of data at once. For example: a list of students in a class, a list of prices in a shop, or a list of daily temperatures.\nIn Python, a list is a collection of values, written inside square brackets []:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same way that floats, ints, strings and booleans are data types in Python, so is a list. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list can contain as many elements as you want, and they don’t all have to be the same type.\nYou can also ask for one item at a time using its index (position in the list). Python uses zero-indexing, which means it starts counting from 0:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list is an example of an iterable object.\nAn iterable object is any Python object that contains a countable number of elements; in other words, it’s an object that can give you it’s elements one by one.\nWe’ve already seen two examples of iterables:\n\nlists are iterables: [10,20,30,40] can give you 10, 20, 30, 40.\nstrings are also iterables: \"hello\" can give you \"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\".\n\nGiven an iterable object, you can create something known as an iterator.\nAn iterator is a special object that lets you step through the elements of an iterable, one at a time, and remembers where you are in the process. In Python, you can create an iterator from an iterable using the built-in function iter():\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe useful thing about an iterator is that it lets us print elements out one by one, always remembering where we were up to. Specifically, we can use the built-in next function to get each element in turn:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA particularly useful example of an iterable object is the output of the range function. You can think of range(n) as a compact way of representing the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. In other words, it produces an iterable containing the first n non-negative integers, ready to be used in computations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: By modifying the above code, work out what happens if you give range two inputs instead of one. e.g. what does range(2,4) do?\n\nRecap: In this section, we introduced a new data type, the list, and saw that lists (as well as strings) are examples of iterables. We also learned about iterators, which are the tools Python uses to step through those iterables one element at a time.\nTo summarize, here are the definitions of iterable and iterator:\n\nIterable: an object that multiple elements (like a list or string) that can be listed off one at a time.\nIterator: an object that remembers a position within an iterable and produces the next element each time you ask for it.\n\nIn the next section, we will see how you can move through values of an iterable object automatically using a for loop.\n\nNote: If you would like to learn more about lists, have a look at the week 1 intermediate notebook on collections. This will show you various operations that can be performed on lists, as well as introduce you to other iterable data types such as tuples, sets and dictionaries.",

    "text": "for loops\nIn the last section, we saw how an iterator can give us the elements of an iterable one at a time using the next() function. But having to write next() repeatedly is a bit repetitive and clunky…\nPython gives us a much simpler way to go through all the elements of an iterable: the for loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this code:\n\nnumbers is the iterable.\nnum is a variable that takes on the value of each element, one at a time.\n\nThe indented block of code under the loop (print(num)) runs once for each element.\nLet’s break down the general syntax of the for loop. The first line must contain the for keyword and a colon, :. These tell us where the for loop starts.\n\n`for` keyword                colon\n  ↓                           ↓\nfor my_variable in my_iterable:\n    print(\"My variable now equals\", my_variable)\n\n\nThen, after the for, we must name a variable. Here my_variable is just a name you are choosing to represent an arbitrary element in the iterable object. &gt;\n &gt;   variable name  \n &gt;         ↓                    \n &gt; for my_variable in my_iterable:\n &gt;     print(\"My variable now equals\", my_variable)\n &gt; \nAfter the variable is named we write the the in keyword followed by my_iterable. Here my_iterable is the iterable variable you want to loop through (for instance, a list or string) and the in keyword tells us that we are looking at values in that iterable. &gt;\n &gt;      `in` keyword    iterable object  \n &gt;                 ↓        ↓\n &gt; for my_variable in my_iterable:\n &gt;     print(\"My variable now equals\", my_variable)\n &gt; \nFinally, inside the loop, we provide the code we want to run for every value of my_variable. In this case we are just printing it’s value.\n\nfor my_variable in my_iterable:\n    print(\"My variable now equals\", my_variable)  ← body of the for loop\n\n\nLet’s see some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Make sure you understand this last example. How would you modify it to print the length of each word in the sentence? Hint: You might need the len() function from the week 1 beginner notebook.\n\nWarning: Just like with an if statement, the body of a for loop must be indented. If you forget to indent, or if the indentation is inconsistent, Python will raise an error.",

    "section": "while loops",
    "text": "while loops\nA for loop is useful when we want to repeat a computation once for every element in an iterable. But sometimes, instead of looping over a collection, we want to keep running a computation until a certain condition is met.\nFor example, we might want to:\n\nkeep rolling a die (generating random integers between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\)) until we get a six, or\nkeep doubling a value until it becomes larger than 100.\n\nTo handle situations like these, Python provides the while loop.\nA while loop repeatedly runs a block of code so long as a given Boolean statement is True. For example, in the below, the block of code is run while the statement n &lt; 10 is True.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe syntax for a while loop looks very similar to an if statement. A while loop is introduced using the keyword while and a colon ::\n\nwhile keyword  colon\n  ↓             ↓\nwhile my_boolean:\n    # Run some code\n\n\nIn-between these, we must include a booean statement, e.g. my_boolean.\n\nBoolean statement\n          ↓\nwhile my_boolean:\n    # Run some code\n\n\nFinally, the indented lines underneath form the body of the loop. This is the part that runs repeatedly:\n\nwhile my_boolean:\n    # Run some code  ← body of the while loop\n\n\nThe body will keep running again and again as long as the boolean expression evaluates to True. It is worth making the comparison between if statements and while loops explicit:\n\nAn if statement checks its condition once and runs the body a single time (if True).\nA while loop keeps checking the condition and repeats the body until the condition becomes False.\n\nLet’s look at a small worked example to make the while loop syntax clearer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we can imagine the while loop as if Python were repeating the indented code over and over:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter every repetition, the loop is checking whether the boolean i &lt; 3 is True. Since, on the last repetition i is now equal to 3, the condition is False, so the loop does not run another time. That is, the while loop ends there.\n\nWarning: A while loop will keep running as long as its boolean condition is True. If the condition never becomes False, the loop will never end. This is called an infinite loop.\nFor example, the following code never terminates because i is never updated (run this at your peril!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid infinite loops, you must ensure that the boolean eventaully becomes False.\nOf course, mistakes are inevitable. In a Jupyter notebook, an infinite loop can freeze the cell. If this happens, do one of the following:\n\nClick the \"stop\" button (■) in the toolbar, or\nUse the menu: Kernel -&gt; Interrupt.\nUse the menu: Kernel -&gt; Restart.\n\nThe last option completely restarts the Python notebook and clears everything from memory, so use it only as a last resort.",

    "text": "Nested Loops\nOne of the most useful features of loops is that you can nest them inside one another.\nThat means you can put a for loop inside a while loop, a while loop inside a for loop, or even nest loops of the same kind. This is powerful as it lets us perform tasks that require multiple layers of repetition. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: If you have already run the three code boxes above, clear the output from each. On paper, use your understanding of loops to predict exactly what each example will print. Rerun the code to check your answers.\n\nTo see why nested loops are useful, let’s work through an example.\nSuppose we want to list all prime numbers up to a given number n.\nIntuitively we need to check whether each number between \\(1\\) and \\(n\\) is prime. We can visualise this like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how do we do the check inside the loop? Well, let’s take an example value of i, say i = 7. If we were doing this task by hand, we’d check if 7 is divisible by 2, then by 3, then by 4, and so on until we reach 7. This can be done with a loop too:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Why does the above code work? If you are unsure, ask one of the demonstrators for help!\n\nThis code tells us if one value (here i=7) is prime. But, how can we relate this to our original problem, checking if all values between 1 and n are prime? The answer is simply that we can place this code inside our larger loop from earlier:",

Write some code which prints the numbers 1 to 100 in reverse order. That is, 100 should be printed first, then 99 and so on…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: Below is an integer n. Using a while loop, compute the factorial of \\(n\\) given by \\(n!=n\\times (n-1)\\times... \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: Using a for loop, print the square of all of the elements in the list below which are greater than \\(2\\) or less than \\(-2.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow do the same, but saving the elements in a new list named output_list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You can add a new element to a list by using the append method. An example of this is given in the below code block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5: Without running the below code, predict how many times the word \"Python\" will be printed. Explain your answer, and then verify it by running the below code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6: The below code uses a while loop to count the number of vowels in the word word. However, something has gone wrong! The below code will never terminate when run. Explain why this has happened and implement a fix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Be careful running this code! As mentioned above, in it’s current form, the code will never terminate.\n\nQuestion 7: Using a loop, work through the dictionary of exam results below to find the difference between the highest and lowest scores. Print the names of the students who achieved those scores. You may assume that all scores like between \\(0\\) and \\(100\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In this question, we are using the dictionary datatype. Dictionaries in Python allow us to store data as key-value pairs. In this case, the key is a student’s name, and the value is their exam score. For this question, you need to know that you can access individual items like print(exam_results['Liam Turner']) and you can obtain a list of all the keys (student names) using names_in_dict = exam_results.keys(). If you would like to learn more about the dictionary datatype, please have a look at the week 1 intermediate notebook.\n\nQuestion 8: Use two nested for loops to print the first n lines of Pascal’s Triangle. For instance, if \\(n=5\\) your code should print:\n1 \n1 1 \n1 2 1 \n1 3 3 1 \n1 4 6 4 1 \n1 5 10 10 5 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9: A palendromic number is an integer that reads the same when its digits are reversed.\nFor example:\n\n\\(124\\) is not palindromic, because reversing the digits gives \\(421\\neq 124\\).\n\\(121\\) is palindromic, because reversing the digits gives \\(121=121\\).\n\nUsing the range function together with a for loop, compute all palindromic numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(1000\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You can reverse a string using [::-1] as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of slicing. If you would like to learn more about slicing lists see the Week 1 (Intermediate) notebook.\nQuestion 10: Using a while loop and a for loop, compute the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from \\(1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: These loops may need to be nested inside one another!",

    "text": "Beginner: For and While Loops\nQuestion 1: The below code box contains an answer to this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to give students some practice thinking about while loops, and in particular, when they should terminate. If students are struggling, emphasize the fact that, if we were doing this task by hand, we would look at the words one by one, and that we only stop writing when there are no more words left. Try to get the students to translate this natural language into code.\n\nQuestion 2: A solution is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to encourage students to form a habit of looking up documentation for themselves. Please do not give them the answer straight away, but instead encourage them to look up online resources.\n\nQuestion 3: The below code computes the factorial with a while loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Like Question 1, this question aims to get students thinking about while loops and when they should terminate. If the students are struggling, have them perform the computation by hand on paper. They will likely compute \\(6 \\times 5\\) first, then multiply that by \\(4\\) and so on, stopping only when they hit \\(1\\). Try to relate the steps they perform to the process of coding the while loop.\n\nQuestion 4: An answer to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question aims to give students practice combining conditional logic with loops. For many students, this may also be the first time they are encountering the idea of appending value to a list inside each iteration of a for loop. A common error in this question is AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'. If you see this error, the chances are the student has written output_list = output_list.append(i**2) when they should just have output_list.append(i**2). The append function does not return anything, it just adds the element to the list, so writing output_list = ... just sets output_list to None.\n\nQuestion 5: The code will print \"Python\" four times, one for each power of two.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Encourage students to write this one out on paper if they are stuck. Again, this question is mainly for practice so try to avoid giving them the answer directly where possible.\n\nQuestion 6: The problem here is that the position = position + 1 is incorrectly indented and thus the position only changes when we encounter vowels. Once we encounter a consonant, we get stuck at that position indefinitely, never updating. The solution is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to give students practice debugging code. Encourage them to use the print function to help them understand what is happening on each iteration of the while loop.\n\nQuestion 7: An example answer is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The correct output for this question is: Difference between highest and lowest scores: 61 Highest score: Ava Brooks with 99 Lowest score: Noah Murphy with 38 This is the first time students have been asked to compute a maximum/minimum using loops. If students are struggling with this, simplify the problem and ask them to work out only the maximum of a single list using a for loop, working through the solution with them on paper first if you need to.\n\nQuestion 8: A solution to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is tough, so reassure students if they are struggling with it. Also, be aware that many students may not have studied Pascal’s triangl and be unaware of it’s construction. Make sure the student understands the context of the question (i.e. what Pascal’s triangle actually is), before offering to help them solve it.\n\nQuestion 9: One possible solution is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: A common stumbling point is that students don’t realize they must convert the integer to a string to reverse its digits. To help them see this, suggest working through a simple example like n=102 (ignoring the loop for now): guide them step-by-step on converting to a string, reversing it, and checking if it’s a palindrome.\n\nQuestion 10: Here is an example solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The expected solution is \\(840\\). If a student is struggling, provide them with a candidate number (e.g. candidate=480) and have them write some code to check whether this candidate is divisibly by \\(1,...,8\\). Then ask them how they might expand on this code by looping over all possible candidates."

If students need help on this question, advise them to read over the section on enumerate and zip. If they are still struggling, advise them to drop a level and attempt the beginner notebook.\n\nQuestion 2: Below is a solution for this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Many students may still be fairly new to the idea of an index, so it is worth checking they understand the question correctly before helping with the code on this question. It is also expected that many will forget that Python is zero-indexed, but will not voice their confusion. Make sure they understand which index corresponds to which element in the list. The expected output for this question is:\n[0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19]\n\nQuestion 3: The answer to this question is to change the break to a continue. This is as the break ends the loop prematurely, whilst continue just skips to the next iteration. The current code gets to num=1 and then executes the break statement, thus terminating the loop early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Encourage students who are struggling to consider what the break statement is doing in this code. If necessary, advise them to revisit the break, continue and pass section. The hope is that this will prompt them to consider the differences between these keywords.\n\nQuestion 4: Solution code is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is drawing on several concepts and is technically challenging. It is expected that some students will have forgotten how to append to a list. If a student is struggling with this, prompt them to attempt question 4 from the beginner notebook as a warmup for this question. This should hopefully encourage them to think about building collections one item at a time using append.\n\nQuestion 5: The error in this code is the indentation of the else block. Here else should be at the same level as the if to make an if... else. However, it is at the level of the for creating a for...else. This means that it will always be executed for the last day so long as a break is not encountered in the loop. To rectify this, we just indent like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Encourage students who are struggling with this to revisit the for and else section."

If, even with help, a student is really struggling with this, suggest that they drop a difficulty level and look at the intermediate material.\n\nQuestion 2: The answer to this question is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The “trick” to this question is to convert the integer to a string and loop over the characters of the string. A student who doesn’t spot this immediately is unlikely to realise this is how to solve the problem later. So, for this question, it is fine to give them a guided solution rather than trying to give prompts.\n\nQuestion 3: Below is list comprehension for this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is challenging and it is expected that many students will struggle with the inner list comprehension. If a student is struggling, focus on a single value of n and talk them through how you might check that n is pluriperfect.\n\nQuestion 4: The solution is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The main objective of this question is for students to recognise that the set comprehension is the most appropriate choice when you need to list unique values. If they are using some other form of comprehension, please prompt them to reconsider this decision.\n\nQuestion 5: The correct answer to this question is to use a generator comprehension, so that the values inside the comprehension are computed lazily (only when needed). If we use a list comprehension for this task, we will end up trying to compute 10000000000 values instantly and crash the memory.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The actual code for this answer would be very slow, as it is performing a very large computation. This is why the students have been told not to implement any code. However, the equivalent computation, when performed with a list comprehension, would consume too much memory and could crash the notebook entirely, so the generator comprehension is still preferable. If the students ask, tell them that we will cover more efficient tools for this task later in the course when we look at numpy."

    "text": "List Comprehensions\nIn this section, we shall look at a nice short-hand for creating a list using a for loop known as a list comprehension. To get started let’s consider the following for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven a list of numbers, numbers, this code looks through the list one-by-one, squaring each element and saving it in the numbers_squared list. This code is nice, but quite long for a fairly simple operation.\nThe same logic can be written more concisely with a list comprehension as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, we still have a lot of the syntax from the original for loop (we keep the keywords for and in for instance), but the code is now much shorter and potentially more readable.\nIn general the syntax for a list comprehension is as follows:\n\nresult = [expression for item in iterable]\n\nLet’s break this down a little. In this syntax, we have: - iterable: The sequence we loop over (e.g. a list, string, range,… etc). - item: The variable representing the current element from the iterable. - expression: What we want to calculate using item. - for... in: These express the for loop itself. - []: This indicates that we are building a list. - result: The variable we save the output to.\nHere are two more examples of a list comprehensions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Using your knowledge of list comprehensions, explain what the above code is doing. What are the list_comprehension1 and list_comprehension2 lists counting? Why is the last element of list_comprehension2 equal to zero?\n\nList comprehensions are not the only type of comprehension in Python. The same concise syntax can be used to build sets and dictionaries.",

The comprehension just combines the loop and assignment into a single, concise expression.\nAgain the syntax is similar here, but this time we have:\n\nresult = {key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}\n\nNotice that we are still using curly braces {}, just like in a set comprehension.

We might instead want to:\n\nOnly include items that meet some condition.\nOr transform items differently depending on a condition.\n\nComprehensions let us do both of these by combining them with conditional expressions.\nFiltering Items: A conditional at the end of a comprehension can be keep items which satisfy a certain criteria and disregard others. For instance, the below list comprehension keeps only the even numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comprehension says:\n\nloop through the numbers 0–9,\ncheck if each one is divisible by 2,\nand only keep those which are divisible by 2.\n\nThe equivalent for loop looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis same idea also works for sets and dictionaries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Make sure you understand the above code before moving on. How would you modify the set comprehension to select odd numbers instead?\n\nConditional Expressions Inside a Comprehension: Instead of filtering, you can also use a conditional expression inside the comprehension to decide how to transform each item. Here every element is included, but its value depends on the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comprehension says:\n\nloop through the numbers 0–5,\nuse the number as the key,\nand store \"even\" or \"odd\" as the value depending on whether it divides by 2.\n\nThe equivalent for loop is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Further information on conditional expressions can be found in the week 2 advanced notebook.",

    "text": "Generator Comprehensions\nAll the comprehensions we have seen so far (lists, sets, and dictionaries) build the entire collection as soon as you define them. Python loops through the iterable right away, computes every result, and stores them in memory.\nThat is fine for small data, but if the sequence is very large the computation can use a lot of memory. Often we do not need to keep everything at once. Instead, it is better to produce values only when they are actually needed.\nA generator comprehension allows us to do exactly that. It looks just like a list comprehension, but uses round parentheses () instead of square brackets [].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, squares is not a list. It is a generator object. Instead of computing and storing all the values at once, it creates them one at a time as you iterate over it. This makes generator comprehensions memory efficient, since nothing is stored unnecessarily. They only ever evaluate on demand, producing values when the program asks for them.\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis calculates the sum of a million squares efficiently because Python generates each square only when the sum() function requests it, and then discards it right away.\nGenerator comprehensions are preferable when you need to perform computations that are larger than you can fit in memory. However, generator comprehensions can also be slower than list comprehensions, as they require more access to physical memory. In practice, which tool is best will depend upon the task you are doing.",

Because of this, they are sometimes called anonymous functions.\nThe general syntax is:\n\nlambda arguments: expression\n\nFor instance, consider the below function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can write exactly the same code using a lambda function as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice a few things:\n\nThere is no def or return here.\nThe return is implicit: the result of the expression is what gets returned.\nTo use the function, we assigned it to a variable (here, my_function).\n\nAlthough we assigned the function to a variable here, we could have used it directly, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first sight, this might not look very different from a normal function. The main reason to use lambda is when you want a small, throwaway function that you do not plan to reuse elsewhere.\nFor example, instead of writing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can instead write:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we created the function and used it immediately, all in one line.\nThere are, of course, limitations to the lambda syntax. - A lambda can only contain a single expression. - You cannot put multiple lines of logic, loops, or assignments inside.\nAs a result, for more complicated computations, it is often preferable to use normal def functions. Nevertheless, the lambda syntax, and more broadly the Lambda calculus upon which it’s based, is a useful tool for writing quick and interpretable code.",

But in fact, behind the scenes, this is what we are always doing whenever we define a function. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, we have created an object called my_function. That object happens to be a function, but it can still be treated like any other variable: it can be passed around, stored in data structures, or even overwritten.\nBecause functions are objects, we can pass them into other functions. For instance, consider the below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have defined two functions, f and g, but passed them into run_on_input_of_five as though they are variables.\nNote that run_on_input_of_five doesn’t know in advance which function it will be given. It just accepts a function object as input and calls it with the argument 5.\n\nTest your Understanding: Write a function h such that:\n\nIf it is given the input 5, it returns the string \"example output\".\nFor any other input, it returns the string \"not 5\".\n\nWhat do you think will happen when you run run_on_input_of_five(h)? Verify your answer by running the command yourself.\n\nSometimes it is useful to refer to a function that takes other functions as input as a higher-order function (if you study category theory later on in other modules, you may also hear these referred to as functionals). Higher-order functions are extremely powerful, because they let us build general tools that work with any function we choose to give them.\nIn the following sections, we will look at some commonly used built-in higher-order functions in Python: map, filter, and reduce.",

Its general form is:\n\nmap(function, iterable)\n\nFor example, suppose we want to square every number in a list. Normally we might write a loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith map, we can do this more directly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that map returns a special object, so we usually convert it into a list to see the results.\nSince map only needs a function once, it is common to use a lambda instead of defining a full function.

Instead of working on elements one by one and producing a list, reduce applies a function over and over again to the elements of an iterable, each time using the previous result as one of the inputs. In this way, the entire iterable is “reduced” to a single value.\nUnlike map and filter, reduce is not an in-built Python function. To use reduce, we must import it from Python’s functools module:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This is the first time in this course that we have used an import statement. Do not worry too much if you are not sure what this means yet. We will use this syntax a lot later on in the course.\n\nThe general form of the reduce function is:\n\nreduce(function, iterable)\n\nHere, the function must take two arguments. reduce will apply the function it step by step through the iterable. To understand this, let’s look at an example.\nSuppose we have a list of words and we want to join them into a single string with spaces in between. Using a for loop we might write:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reduce, we can write the same loop as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, reduce is doing the following:\n\nIt first takes the first two elements, words[0] and words[1], and applies my_concatenate to produce a new string (let’s call this result1).\nNext, it takes result1 together with the third element, words[2], and applies my_concatenate again to produce result2.\nIt then repeats this process, each time combining the current result with the next element of the list, until there are no elements left.\nThe final value produced is returned as the overall output of reduce.\n\nIn other words, it is doing the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the previous examples, we can simplify the above code using lambda functions.

In this notebook, we will use some more precise Python terminology for inputs: parameters and arguments.\n\nA parameter is the variable listed in a function’s definition. It acts as a placeholder that says “this function expects a value here.”\nAn argument is the actual value you provide when calling the function.\n\nFor instance, consider the simple function below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, name is the parameter. It is the label inside the function that will hold the input. \"Sofia\" is the argument. It is the concrete value we supply when calling the function.\nThere are two main ways to pass arguments to a function in Python: - Positional arguments are matched to parameters by the order they appear. - Keyword arguments are matched to parameters by name, using the parameter=value syntax.\nTo see what we mean here, consider the following example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first call to make_greeting uses positional arguments. This means that arguments are assigned based on the order they are passed into the function. Here, \"Hello\" is matched to greeting and \"Brad\" is matched to name by position.\nThe second call to make_greeting uses keyword arguments. This means that the arguments are matched by name, using the parameter=value syntax. Here, \"Liam\" goes to name and \"Hi\" goes to greeting, even though the order is reversed.\nIn the first half of this notebook, we will look at the different kinds of parameters Python allows us to define, and how arguments can be passed to them in flexible ways.",

This can be useful because it reduces repetition and makes your code cleaner.\nFor example, consider the following repetitive code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not very efficient. It would be much easier if we could just write one function that sums any number of values. One way to do this is to pass a tuple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works, but notice that the function calls require two sets of round brackets, which, even for this simple example, is slightly clunky and could easily lead to mistakes.\nPython provides a cleaner way of writing the above code using the * operator. This collects all positional arguments into a single tuple inside the function like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code inside the function is essentially the same, but now the function calls look much cleaner since we can pass in values directly without square brackets.\nBy convention, when using the * operator to pass arbitrary positional arguments into a function, we name the tuple we pass in args, which stands for “arguments”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have seen how to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments. But what if we want to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments?\nImagine we tried to write separate functions for describing a person:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code is pretty repetitive and messy. One way we could imagine simplifying this code is by using if statements and a dictionary, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works, but again the code feel awkward because we now have to write out a dictionary whenever we call the function.\nPython provides a cleaner way of writing the above code the ** operator. This gathers all keyword arguments into a dictionary inside the function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of naming the dictionary my_dict like in the above code, by convention we use tend to use the name kwargs, which is short for “keyword arguments”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same way that we can write a function which takes as input both a tuple and a dictionary, such as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can instead write a function that takes both arbitrary positional arguments and arbitrary keyword arguments, using *args and **kwargs:",

But sometimes we want more control. Python gives us two special symbols for this:\n\n/ means everything to the left of it must be positional-only.\n* means everything to the right of it must be keyword-only.\n\nSo you can think of / and * as markers in the parameter list that divide it into three possible regions:\nmy_function(a,b,/,c,d,*,e,f)\nHere, we have that:\n\na and b are positional-only parameters.\nc and d can be specified using position or keyword.\ne and f are keyword-only parameters.\n\nLet’s, look at some examples. The below function will take positional arguments only:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, x and y are to the left of /, so they can only be given by position.\nSimilarly, this example will accept keyword arguments only:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, name and age are to the right of *, so they must be given as keywords.\nWe can allow a function to have a mix of all three types of parameters (positional-only, keyword or positional, or keyword-only) as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your Understanding: Without writing code, consider the following expressions:\n\ndemo(1, 2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6)\ndemo(a=1, 2, 5, e=3, d=4, f=6)\ndemo(1, 2, c=5, e=3, d=4, f=6)\ndemo(1, 2, d=3, 4, e=5, f=6)\n\nWhat do you think each of the above will print and why?

Now let’s shift focus slightly and look at another useful trick when writing functions: multiple return statements.\nNormally, a function ends when it reaches a return statement. But functions can also contain more than one return, which allows us to stop the function and send back a result as soon as we know what that result should be.\nHere’s a simple example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function stops running the moment it hits a return. To understand why this feature might be useful, consider the below code which computes the length of each string in a list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works, but it’s a bit cumbersome as we are keeping track of the result variable throughout. We can simplify this code substantially using multiple return statements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the logic is much cleaner:\n\nIf the list is empty, return immediately.\nIf we find a bad entry, return immediately.\nOtherwise, return the processed list.\n\nThe key idea here is that a return statement ends the function immediately. Everything after it is skipped. You can think of it as if Python is automatically wrapping everything after a return in an invisible else.\nThis often makes your functions shorter, easier to read, and can help spot errors and bugs.",

    "text": "What is a Function?\nFunctions are a handy way of parceling up your code, making it easier to reuse, share, and organize. You can think of a function as a block of “pre-prepared” code that you might want to run again and again.\nYou’ve already used a lot of functions without realizing it - for instance:\n\nprint() to display text\n\"hello\".split() to split strings\nstr(), int(), and float() to convert between types\n\nAnything that looks like a name followed by round brackets () is usually a function in Python.\nTo understand why functions are useful, suppose we were writing some code, and it ended up looking something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this program there are several places where we are doing the same operation: doubling a number, adding one, and then printing the result.\nWe can’t use a loop here, since the overall program is not simply repeating over and over, but it is clear that this calculation is repetitive. This is the kind of situation where functions are useful.\nWe can put the repeated logic into a function and give it a name. In Python, functions are created using the def keyword, followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses, and a colon. The code inside the function is indented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Much like if statements and loops, indentation is very important for functions. Whilst in other languages such as Matlab there are keywords signifying when a function ends (such as end); in Python the only way to tell which code is and is not inside a function is through indentation. In short, make sure your indentation is present and consistent! Also, don’t forget the colon after the def expression!\n\nNow we can call our function whenever we need that same operation, without having to repeat the calculation each time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis version of the program behaves exactly the same, but the repeated calculation is written only once, inside the function. If we ever needed to change the logic (for example, triple the number instead of double it), we would only have to update the function (instead of updating the three lines it was used on one by one).",

    "section": "Inputs and Outputs",
    "text": "Inputs and Outputs\nYou can think of a function a bit like a black box: you put some inputs into it, the function runs some code, and it gives you a result.\nFor example, the print_double_and_add_one function we saw earlier took in a number x, doubled it, added one, and printed the result.\nUp until now, our functions have only printed things. But often we want a function to return a result that we can use later in our program. This is done with the return keyword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how this function doesn’t print the result directly. Instead, it returns it. We then stored the result in m and printed it afterwards.\n\nTest your understanding: Try changing the value of k above. What do you think will happen when you do this?\n\n\nNote: We can also write return(y) instead of return y. Both are valid and do exactly the same thing.\n\nOnce a return statement is reached, the function ends immediately. Any code written after it will not be executed. For instance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA function doesn’t just have to have one input. Multiple inputs to a function can be specified like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Write some code which calls this function on the values x=3 and y=2. Predict what output your code will give, and check your answer by running the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple outputs can also be returned like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we don’t want all the outputs, we can ignore one with the underscore _:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions can also be written with no inputs or outputs at all. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput arguments are named, meaning you can call the function on inputs by using their names, rather than by using the order they were defined in. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify default values for inputs so that if an input is not entered, the function will assume it takes some predefined value. For example:",

    "section": "Variable Scope",
    "text": "Variable Scope\nWhen we create variables inside a function, those variables only exist inside the function. The region of the program where a variable can be used is called the scope of the variable.\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable output_variable is created inside the function, so it only exists while the function is running. Once the function finishes, output_variable disappears.\nVariables created inside a function are called local variables. They can’t be accessed outside of the function.\nOn the other hand, variables created outside of a function are called global variables, and they can be used inside functions (though usually it’s better practice to pass them in as inputs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, it’s good practice to:\n\nUse function inputs and outputs rather than relying on global variables.\nGive your variables clear names so you don’t accidentally confuse a local variable with a global one.",

    "text": "Exercises\nQuestion 1: Below is a simple function with two inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think will be printed when each of the following is run?\n\nmy_simple_function(3,4)\nmy_simple_function(y=3,x=4)\nmy_simple_function(y=4)\nmy_simple_function()\nmy_simple_function(x=3)\n\nExplain your results and verify your answers by running the code.\nQuestion 2: Write a function that takes a string my_string as input and returns the number of uppercase letters it contains. For example, if the input is \"this Is mY string\", the function should return 2.\nHint: Recall from week 3 that a string is an iterable object. This means that you can iterate over the characters in a string using for character in my_string:. You may also wish to use the upper function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: In physics, energy can take different forms. In this question, you will write two functions to calculate kinetic and potential energy.\n\nThe first, calculate_kinetic_energy, should take mass (in kg) and velocity (in m/s) as inputs and return the kinetic energy, E_k, computed using the formula \\(E_{K} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\). For example, if the mass is 2 kg and velocity is 10 m/s, the function should return 100.0.\nThe second, calculate_potential_energy, should take mass (in kg), height (in m), and gravity (in m/s²) as inputs and return the gravitational potential energy, E_p, computed using the formula \\(E_{P} = mgh\\). For example, if mass is 1 kg, height is 50 m, and gravity is 9.8 m/s², the function should return 490.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: Your task in this question is to write code which models the behaviour of a ball falling from rest.\nTo begin, you must create a list of time points from 0 to 5 seconds in increments of 0.1 seconds. For every time point, you must then compute the velocity of the ball, using \\(v = gt\\) (\\(g = 9.8\\) m/s²), and the height of the ball using \\(h = h_0 - \\frac12gt^2\\) (where \\(h_0 = 100\\) m is the initial height from which it is dropped). You must record the values in three lists named times, velocities, and heights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you must use the functions you wrote in Question 3 to calculate the kinetic and potential energy at each time and store the results in lists called kinetic_energy and potential_energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have created the lists named times, kinetic_energy and potential_energy, you can run the below code, which should create a plot of the two forms of energy against time. Try to describe what these plots are telling you. Are the energies increasing or decreasing over time? How do you explain their behaviour?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Don’t worry if you are unsure what the import and from keywords are doing in the above code. For now, you can think of these as a way of loading in pre-written functions such as the plot_energy_over_time function. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice and understand these features of Python as the course goes on.\n\nQuestion 5: The below code will load a function called time which you can run as time(). See if you can work out what this function does (you may have to look online).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6: Often in speech-to-text processing, spoken audio is transcribed as text. This can produce long strings of English sentences that have been automatically generated from speech. One common problem is that people often use filler words such as \"um\", \"uh\", \"uhm\", \"er\", and \"err\".\nWrite a function remove_filler which takes in a string containing transcribed speech and returns a new string with the same speech but with the filler words listed above removed. For instance, given the text\n\"Um I was, uh, going to the store but uhm I er forgot.\"\nyour function should return\n\"I was, going to the store but I forgot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You may want to consider the split function for strings for this problem.\nQuestion 7: Consider the following badly written code that uses both a global and a local variable with the same name, x. When you run the code, you’ll notice that the two print statements output different values. By performing your own research online if necessary, see if you can explain why the value printed inside the function differs from the value printed outside the function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8: The \\(n\\)th Fibonnaci number, \\(F(n)\\), is defined by the following recurrence relation;\n\\(F(0)=0, F(1)=1\\) and \\(F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)\\) for \\(n&gt;1\\)\nWrite a function Fibonnaci which takes in a list of integers [x1,x2,...,xk] of arbitrary length and returns their corresponding fibonnaci numbers, i.e. [F(x1),F(x2),...,F(xk)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9: The “Look and Say” sequence is a sequence of integers defined in the following way.\n\nThe first member of the “Look and Say” sequence is 1, i.e. \\(l(1) = 1\\).\nTo generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:\n\n1 is read off as “one 1” or 11 (\\(l(2) = 11\\)).\n11 is read off as “two 1s” or 21 (\\(l(3) = 21\\)).\n21 is read off as “one 2, then one 1” or 1211 (\\(l(4) = 1211\\)).\n1211 is read off as “one 1, one 2, then two 1s” or 111221 (\\(l(5) = 111221\\)).\n111221 is read off as “three 1s, two 2s, then one 1” or 312211 (\\(l(6) = 312211\\)).\n\n\nWrite a function which, given the kth integer from the look and say sequence, \\(l(k)\\), computes the (k+1)th integer in the sequence, \\(l(k+1)\\). Hint: The str function may be helpful for this task!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10: Using your function from Question 9, now write a function las_k which given an integer, \\(k\\), returns the kth look and say number, \\(l(k)\\). Give 3 reasons why you think it may be useful to lay out your code in functions in this way.",

    "section": "Tutorial: The Robot Maze",
    "text": "Tutorial: The Robot Maze\nToday, you will be programming a robot to navigate a small maze. To get started, run the code box below. This will load in the RobotMaze function which we will be working with today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Robot Maze\nThe RobotMaze function will create a new randomly generated maze with a robot inside it. Try running the below code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can view the robot in the maze using robot.render().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down what we can see here. The maze contains:\n\nWhite Squares: Open spaces, which the robot has not yet visited.\nBlack squares: Walls. The robot cannot walk into these.\nGrey squares: These are open spaces that the robot has visited previously.\nA red circle with a white arrow: This is the robot. The arrow tells us which way it is facing.\nA green circle with a T: This is the target. This is where the robot must move to.\n\nAt the top of the maze, we see the title Robot Maze - Run #1. Here, the number #1 refers to the number of times we have attempted to solve the maze.\nAt the bottom of the maze, we see the Robot Console. This is a handy message box, which we shall use to display messages from the robot throughout this task.\n\n\nMoving the Robot\nHere are some instructions you can give the robot:\n\nrobot.move(): Running this will cause the robot to take one step forward in the direction it is currently facing.\nrobot.turn(): This function takes a string as input. It will turn the robot to the left if the string is \"LEFT\", right if the string is \"RIGHT\", behind if the string is \"BEHIND\" and ahead if the string is \"AHEAD\". The robot always turns relative to the direction it is currently facing (that is, where the white arrow is pointing).\n\nRunning the below code will give the robot the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe robot now knows what it is going to do. To execute the instructions, you must now run robot.render().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the robot bumps into a wall, it will not move forward. Instead, it will print a message to the Robot Console telling you it has bumped into a wall.\n\nIf the robot is moving too fast or slow, you can change the speed at which it moves using the robot.delay parameter. For instance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Each time you run robot.render(), the robot will begin moving from it’s last location on the previous render. Try re-running the above box a few times (maybe with a smaller delay!) to make sure you understand how this works.\n\n\n\nResetting and Saving the Maze\nIf you want to reset the maze, and send the robot back to the start, you can use the robot.reset() command like so. Notice that the title will now say Robot Maze - Run #2, but the Robot Console will keep the robot’s message history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you run the robot = RobotMaze(), a new random maze is generated. Sometimes you might want to save a particular maze to come back to later. You can do this by running robot.get_maze_id(). For instance, to save the maze you have above, you can run the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then load the same maze again later on using my_maze_id. Try commenting out and uncommenting the below lines of code to test your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: You can interrupt a cell that is running in Quarto by pressing the Start Over button.\n\n\n\nAims and Limits\nYour aim in this challenge to write code that moves the robot to the target. However, there is a catch - the robot only has a finite amount of fuel!\nThe robot begins with 100 units of fuel. Each call to robot.move() and robot.turn() costs one unit of fuel. Once the robot has no fuel left, it will not be able to move.\nHere are some functions you can use to check on the robot’s status:\n\nrobot.at_target(): This will return True if the robot is on the target square and False otherwise.\nrobot.check_fuel(): This will tell you how much fuel the robot has left. The amount will be returned as an integer between 0 and 100.\nrobot.print(): This will print a message to the robot console.\n\nThe below code uses the above commands. See if you can understand what it is doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the robot is equipped with a sensor that can detect what type of square is in a given direction.\nTo use the sensor, call the robot.sense() function with one of the following inputs: \"AHEAD\", \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", or \"BEHIND\". The function returns a string describing the square in that direction, returning either \"WALL\", \"EMPTY\", or \"BEEN_THERE\" if the robot has already visited it.\nHave a look at the below code for an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Using the sensor does not require fuel!

In the below code box, you will see there is a function named my_controller. See if you can determine what this controller does before reading ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nice thing about writing our commands for the robot inside a function is that we can now run the entire set of instructions simply by calling the function, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry updating the my_controller function so that the robot first checks for a wall in front of it before attempting to move forward. If a wall is detected, the robot should stay in place and not move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: End of the Road\nContinuing with the my_controller function, modify your code to identify if the robot is:\n\nAt a dead-end (a square surrounded by three walls),\nAt a corner (a square bordering two walls whose corners touch),\nIn a corridor (a square with two walls bordering it on opposing sides),\nNext to a single wall (a square with only one wall bordering it),\nOn an unbordered square (a square sharing no edges with a wall).\n\nUse the robot.print() function to print a message to the console stating which type of square the robot is on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Turning Back\nWrite your own controller function which does the following: - Senses the squares around the robot. - If there at least one of the surrounding squares is \"EMPTY\", the robot should choose an \"EMPTY\" square at random and move to it. - If there are no \"EMPTY\" squares, the robot should choose at random from the \"BEEN_THERE\" squares surrounding it and move to the chosen square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Final Challenge\nIt is now up to you!\nBy doing your own research on maze solving algorithms, choose a method to solve the maze and try writing it up as a controller function. Can you solve the maze faster than the my_controller robot, or your solution to Task 4?\nGood luck!",

    "text": "Guidance\nYou will find that the challenge problems this week are much more open-ended than those you have encountered in previous classes. At first, this might feel a bit intimidating, but please do not fret - you already have all the skills necessary to complete the tasks!\nHere are some general tips to help make the challenges feel less daunting:\n\nPlan before you code: Before writing any code, try taking notes about the background material. Once you understand the background material, think about how you might approach the task by hand, and jot the steps you would perform down on paper.\n\n\nClarify inputs and outputs: When getting started, think about the following questions: - What information do I have before I start coding? (These are likely my inputs.) - What do I want my code to produce? (This is my output.)\n\n\nLook for structure and repetition: When converting your thoughts to code, consider the below: - Which steps of the computation are repetitive? (Think loops!) - Which steps of the computation are self-contained? (Perhaps, I should use a function for these…)\n\n\nDivide and conquer: Try to break the task down into smaller, more manageable chunks, and solve each piece one at a time before putting them together.\n\n\nTalk things through: If you’re struggling to get started, try talking the question through with a peer or class tutor. You might be surprised how much this helps to organise your thoughts!\n\n\nUse resources: Don’t be afraid to use google or Python documentation when you’re thinking about the best way to implement a solution. Sometimes the act of googling alone can help spark new ideas.\n\n\nTrust your own process: Try to avoid using AI when deciding how to structure your code. You will find it much easier to understand and refine your work if the structure comes from your own reasoning.\n\nAbove all, remember that coding can be hard! At times, it might feel like you’re running into the same problem over and over without making much progress. If you feel this way, don’t worry - this is a perfectly normal part of the process. If you keep trying, you will get there!",

    "text": "Background\n\nMeasuring Gravity with a Picket Fence and Photogate\nA classic experiment in introductory physics is the photogate picket fence experiment. In this setup, a picket fence (a clear plastic strip with evenly spaced opaque bars) is dropped vertically through a photogate sensor.\n\nThe photogate shines an infrared beam across a small gap. A sensor on the other side detects whether the beam makes it through or not. If the beam is blocked (by one of the bars), the sensor records 'x'. If the beam is not blocked, the sensor records 'o'. Every \\(\\Delta t = 0.5\\) milliseconds (\\(=0.0005s\\)) the photogate logs whether the beam is blocked or not.\nBecause the bars on the picket fence are evenly spaced, the vertical distance between the start of one bar and the start of the next is always the same:\n\\[\n\\Delta d = 5 \\text{cm (constant distance between bars).}\n\\]\nAs the picket fence falls through the photogate, each bar successively blocks the beam. By measuring the time between when one bar starts blocking the beam and when the next bar does, we can estimate the velocity of the falling object. From changes in velocity, we can then estimate the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n\nThe Data\n\nNote: Before starting this challenge, if you haven’t already, you may wish to read the sections on dictionaries in the week 1 intermediate notebook. This will be helpful in what follows.\n\nYou are given a Python dictionary that encodes \\(100\\) trials of the photogate picket fence experiment. Each entry:\n\nHas a key like \"Trial 1\", \"Trial 2\", …\nHas a value that is a long string of 'o', 'x', and 'e' characters, representing the sensor state at regular time intervals (recordings are taken \\(\\Delta t\\) seconds apart). We can interpret these as follows:\n\n'x' = beam blocked (bar in photogate)\n'o' = beam unblocked (gap)\n'e' = error (the sensor glitched)\n\n\nFor example, suppose the dictionary contains the entry:\ndata_dict[\"Trial 1\"] = \"oooxxxoooxexo\"\nThis string represents the sensor readings for the first trial. Each character corresponds to a single timepoint, spaced by \\(\\Delta t = 0.0005\\) s. We can interpret this as follows:\n\nThe first three characters (\"ooo\") mean the beam was unblocked at times \\(t = 0 \\text{ms}\\), \\(5 \\text{ms}\\), and \\(10 \\text{ms}\\),\nThe next three characters (\"xxx\") indicate the beam was blocked at \\(t = 15 \\text{ms}\\), \\(20 \\text{ms}\\), and \\(25 \\text{ms}\\),\nThe next three (\"ooo\") show the beam was unblocked again,\nAt \\(t = 50 \\text{ms}\\), the character is 'e', indicating that the sensor glitched,\nThis is followed by 'x' and 'o' at the final two timepoints.\n\nNote: Across the \\(100\\) trials, several different picket fences were used. Some had the same number of bars, while others did not. Consequently, the number of black and white bars varied between trials.",

    "section": "The Challenge",
    "text": "The Challenge\nYour challenge is to perform the following tasks:\n\nTask 1: Clean the Data\nMany trials contain one or more 'e' (error) characters due to sensor glitches. Apply the following rules to clean each string:\n\nIf an 'e' (or group of 'e's) is adjacent to at least one 'x', replace all 'e's in that group with 'x',\nOtherwise, replace them with 'o'.\n\nFor example, 'ooxexoeoxeeo' would become 'ooxxxoooxxxo'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Detect When Each Bar Begins to Block the Beam\nOnce the data is cleaned, your next task is to identify the exact times at which each bar starts to block the photogate beam.\nThis occurs every time the sensor reading transitions from 'o' (unblocked) to 'x' (blocked). Each from 'o' to 'x' transition corresponds to the leading edge of a bar entering the photogate.\nTo detect these moments:\n\nLoop through the cleaned string from left to right.\nLook for every index i where the character is 'x', and the character just before it (at index i-1) is 'o'.\nFor each such index, compute the time \\(t = i × Δt\\), where \\(\\Delta t =\\) 0.5 milliseconds.\n\nFor each trial, you must save a list of timestamps (in seconds) showing when each bar starts to block the beam. For instance, given this cleaned string:\n\"oooxxxoooxxxooooxxx\"\nYou should detect transitions at indices: 3, 9, and 16 (remember, Python starts counting at 0!). In this case, the corresponding times would be:\n[0.0015, 0.0045, 0.0080] # Computed by doing [3*0.0005,9*0.0005,16*0.0005]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Estimate Average Velocities\nOnce you’ve computed the times when each bar starts to block the beam, you can use those times to estimate the velocity of the falling picket fence.\nFrom the previous, we have;\n\n\\(\\Delta d = 0.05\\) meters is the constant distance between the leading edges of two consecutive bars.\n\\(t_k\\) and \\(t_{k+1}\\) are the times at which two consecutive bars start to block the beam.\n\nWe can now estimate the average velocity of the picket fence between two successive bar detections using:\n\\[\nv_k = \\frac{\\Delta d}{t_{k+1} - t_k}\n\\]\nThis gives the average velocity of the picket fence between the times \\(t_k\\) (when the \\(k^{th}\\) bar first blocks the sensor) and \\(t_{k+1}\\) (when the \\((k+1)^{th}\\) bar does the same).\nFor each trial, you must now use your list of bar-blocking times to compute a list of velocities between each pair of consecutive bars. For instance, if the bar-blocking times for a single trial are:\n[0.0015, 0.0045, 0.0080]\nThen you must compute the velocities:\n\\[v_0= \\frac{0.05}{0.0045-0.0015} = 16.66...\\quad\\text{and}\\quad v_1= \\frac{0.05}{0.0080-0.0045} = 14.28...\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Estimate Accelerations\nNow that you’ve estimated velocities, you can use them to estimate how the instantaneous velocity of the picket fence changes over time - that is, its acceleration.\nIn step 3, each velocity \\(v_k\\) was calculated as an average over a time interval of the form \\([t_k,t_{k+1}]\\). We can treat this as a velocity recorded at the midpoint of the interval. That is, we treat this velocity as though it were recorded at the time \\(\\tau_k\\), defined as:\n\\[\n\\tau_k := \\frac{t_k + t_{k+1}}{2}\n\\]\nTo estimate the acceleration between two consecutive velocities, we need to look at their differences. That is, we must compute:\n\\[\na_k = \\frac{v_{k+1} - v_k}{\\tau_{k+1} - \\tau_k}\n\\]\nThis gives an estimate of the average acceleration between the times \\(\\tau_k\\) and \\(\\tau_{k+1}\\). For each trial, you must now compute all such acceleration values, and then compute the average acceleration across the trial:\n\\[\\overline{a}^{(j)} = \\frac{1}{M_j} \\sum_{k=1}^{M_j} a_k\\] where \\(M_j\\) is the number of acceleration values in trial \\(j\\) (which is one less than the number of velocities).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Estimate \\(g\\)\nTo obtain a final estimate of the gravitational acceleration, we must now average the acceleration values computed across all trials.\nAs in Step 4, let \\(\\overline{a}^{(j)}\\) be the average acceleration for trial \\(j\\), and let \\(N\\) be the total number of trials. Then you must compute your final estimate of \\(g\\), given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{g} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\overline{a}^{(j)}\n\\]\nThis value, \\(\\hat{g}\\), represents your best overall estimate of the acceleration due to gravity based on the experimental data.",

    "text": "Conditional Expressions\nWhen you’re writing code, you’ll often want a variable to take on one value in some situations and a different value in others. A straightforward way to do this is with an if–else statement, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the above code is quite verbose for quite a simple operation. Sometimes, it is more convenient to represent conditional definitions of this form using a conditional expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the conditional expression consists of everything following the equals symbol. The general syntax for a conditional expression is:\n\n&lt;expr1&gt; if &lt;conditional_expr&gt; else &lt;expr2&gt;\n\nWhen you run this, the &lt;conditional_expr&gt; expression in the center is evaluated first. If &lt;conditional_expr&gt; is evaluated as True then &lt;expr1&gt; is evaluated. Otherwise, &lt;expr2&gt; is evaluated.\nNote that this means it is possible that one of &lt;expr1&gt; or &lt;expr2&gt; are never evaluated. For instance, in the below code the first expression should give a division by zero, but because it is never evaluated, no error is thrown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: How could you modify the above code to throw a division by zero error?\n\nWe can incorporate conditional expressions into larger expressions using round brackets (). For instance, the below code computes \\(x+|x|\\) for an input x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Can you think of a way to compute result in the above using a single conditional expression, without adding x?",

    "section": "Lazy Evaluation",
    "text": "Lazy Evaluation\nA conditional expression is a good example of lazy evaluation. In general, an evaluation is called lazy if only the values that are actually needed are computed. For instance, in the example from the previous section, the expression 1/0 was never evaluated - it was skipped entirely as it wasn’t needed - which is what makes the evaluation lazy.\nThe and and or operations we met last week are actually examples of lazy operations. We’ve already seen them used with Booleans, but in Python they can be applied to many other data types as well. Let’s start with a few quick examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first line, both operands are Booleans, so the result is False. But in the later examples, the result is not a Boolean - it’s one of the operands themselves. For instance, 5 and 10 returns 10, while 0 and 99 returns 0. To explain what’s going on here, lets consider what happens when x and y are Booleans and we compute x and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we were computing x and y by hand, we would naturally start by looking at x. If x is False, then the whole expression must also be False - because in an and both sides need to be true. There’s no reason to even check y; we can just return the value of x (that is, False).\nIf, on the other hand, x is True, then the overall result depends entirely on y. In that case, x and y is true if and only if y is true.\nSo a simple way to describe the evaluation of x and y is:\n\nIf x is False, return x.\nIf x is True, return y.\n\nThe same evaluation rules apply even when the operands are numbers, strings, or other kinds of objects. To make this work, Python treats every value as either truthy or falsy when it’s used in a logical expression:\n\nFalsy values behave like False. These include False itself, numeric zero (0, 0.0, etc.), the empty string \"\", empty containers like [] or {}, and None.\nTruthy values behave like True. Almost everything else falls into this category: non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, non-empty lists, and so on.\n\nYou can check whether a variable is Truthy or Falsy by casting it too a Boolean. For example:",

    "text": "The if Statement\nAn if statement allows you to run a block of code if and only if a boolean expression is True. Take the example in the following block, for instance. In this example, “Positive” is printed if the variable my_number is greater than \\(100\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding: Try changing the value of my_number in the above code to be negative. Before moving on, think about what might be happening here; How do you think the if statement decides which statements to print?\n\nLet’s break down exactly what is going on in this if statement.\nAn if always follows the same layout. First, it must include the if keyword and a colon :, like so:\n ↓                ↓\nif my_number &gt; 100:\n    print(my_number, \"is large\")\n\nIn between the if and the :, we must place a boolean variable. The idea here is that we want our code to execute (run) if and only if this boolean is true. In our example the boolean is my_number &gt; 100.\n          ↓\nif my_number &gt; 100:\n    print(my_number, \"is large\")\n\nWe next need to add a body. The body is the lines of code that will be run if the condition has been met:\nif my_number &gt; 100:\n    print(my_number, \"is large\")  ← body of the if statement\n\nPython will only recognise code as being in the body of the if statement if it is indented. This means that all code in the body must be indented relative to the word if by four spaces. A trick to help remember this is that every time you see a colon in Python you should start a new line and indent:\n                colon\n                  ↓\nif my_number &gt; 100:\n    print(my_number, \"is large\")\n  ↑\nindentation\n\nCode that is not indented will be treated as being outside the if statement and run in the usual manner.\nif my_number &gt; 100:\n    print(my_number, \"is large\")\n\nprint(\"This is always printed\")  ← this code will always run as it is outside the if statement\n\nHere are some more examples of if statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that, in the above examples, we have always defined our boolean variable directly between the if and colon :. We didn’t have to do this; we could have instead defined the variable first like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it’s often simpler not to define a separate boolean variable explicitly like we did above. Deciding whether to store something like x_is_positive depends partly on whether you’ll need to reuse it later and partly on personal preference.",

    "section": "Worked Example: Determining a Leap Year",
    "text": "Worked Example: Determining a Leap Year\nSay we wanted to determine whether a year is a leap year (a year with 366 days rather than the usual 365).\nThe first thing we know is that a leap year generally happens every 4 years. So to start off we could impose the following condition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: Last week, we saw that the % operator represents modular arithmetic. This means that a % b gives the remainder when a is divided by b. For example, 10 % 3 gives 1. The above code works as if year % 4 equals 0, then the year must be divisible by 4.\n\nThe rules for determining leap years in the Gregorian calendar are a bit more nuanced than simply being divisible by \\(4\\). In fact, if the year is also divisible by \\(100\\), then it is not a leap year (e.g., \\(1800\\), \\(1900\\), \\(2100\\)).\nWe need to add this new condition to our if statement. This can be done by combining year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 == 0 using an and clause:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try adding a new block to account for the situation where even if the year is divisible by \\(4\\), if it is also divisible by \\(100\\) it is not a leap year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this isn’t right - we saw above that \\(1900\\) is not a leap year so this should say\nIs 1900 a leap year? No\nLet’s go through this line by line. Python checks the first criteria in the if block year % 4 == 0:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this boolean is true, the if statement stops when it is evaluated and exits without checking the other clauses.\nSo how do we make sure Python checks the correct set of conditions first? To do this we have to think about the ordering of the clauses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Python checks the more strict clause first and then exits when the condition year % 100 == 0 and year % 4 == 0 is true:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis updated if statement now gives us the behaviour we desired.",

For example, if day_number = 8, the date is January 8th, and if day_number = 32, the date is February 1st. Write an if statement that determines the current month based on the value of day_number. You may assume the year is not a leap year and that day_number is an integer strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 366.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5: Now suppose you want to adapt your code from Question 4 so that day_number can fall outside the usual range of 1 to 365. For example, day_number = 366 should “wrap around” to January 1st, while day_number = 0 should correspond to December 31st. How would you modify your if statement to handle this? Write your code below. For simplicity, you may continue to ignore leap years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: The % operator might be useful here!\nQuestion 6: The code below has a distance given in kilometres. Assuming 1 mile ≈ 1.60934 km, convert the distance in km to a distance given in miles.

The full definition of a leap year is as follows;\n\nA year is a leap year if it is divisible by \\(4\\) but not by \\(100\\).\n\nUnless…\n\nIf the year is divisible by \\(400\\), then it is a leap year after all (e.g., \\(2000\\), \\(2400\\)).\n\nModify the example of the worked example section to incorporate this final bullet point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8: By performing your own research online, explain what the keyword pass does in the code below and why you might use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you removed the line with pass from the code above?\nQuestion 9: FizzBuzz is a children’s counting game played with the following rules:\n\nPlayers take turns counting up from 1.\nIf a number is divisible by 3, say \"Fizz\".\nIf a number is divisible by 5, say \"Buzz\".\nIf a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say \"FizzBuzz\".\nOtherwise, say the number itself (as a string).\n\nIt’s now your turn. You are given the previous player’s answer, prev_answer, along with the number they just counted, prev_num. Using an if–elif–else statement, print the correct response for your turn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify your code so that if the previous player’s answer was incorrect, your program prints a message pointing out the mistake before giving your own response.\nQuestion 10: The code below contains a horrendous nested if statement.

    "text": "Basic properties of multi-dimensional arrays\n\nShape\nThe shape of a multi-dimensional array is a tuple that describes the size of each dimension. For example, a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns has a shape of (3, 4). You can access the shape of an array using the .shape attribute.\nWe can use many of the array initialisation functions we haver seen for 1d arrays also to create multi-dimensional arrays. For example, we can use np.zeros to create a 2D array of zeros, or np.ones to create a 2D array of ones. We can also use np.random.rand to create a 2D array of random numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis and Rank\nA multi-dimensional array has multiple dimensions, each of which can be thought of as an axis. The number of dimensions is called the rank of the array. For example, a 2D array has a rank of 2, while a 3D array has a rank of 3. It is accessible via the .ndim attribute.\nWe typically call a rank 2 array a matrix. A rank 3 array (or higher) is often called a tensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can perform operations along specific axes of a multi-dimensional array. For example, we can sum all the elements along a specific axis using the np.sum function with the axis parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne can do the same also with useful statistical descriptors such as np.mean, np.std, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicing\nSlicing works similarly to 1D arrays, but you can slice along multiple axes. For example, you can slice a 2D array to get a submatrix or a specific row or column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReshaping and flattening\nThe last example show an inetresting case: we extracted a single column from the matrix, but it is still a 2D array with shape (3, 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted a truly 1d array (rank 1)? We need to reshape the array.\nWe can use the np.reshape function to change the shape of an array without changing its data. For example, we can reshape a 2D array into a 1D array or vice versa.\nReshape takes a tuple of the new shape as an argument. If you want to flatten an array (convert it to a 1D array), you can use -1 as one of the dimensions, which tells NumPy to infer the size of that dimension based on the total number of elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to cast a multi-dimensional array to a 1D array is to use the np.ravel() function, which returns a flattened view of the array (not a copy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we modify the view, we modify the original array as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain a completely independent flattened copy of the array, you can use the np.flatten() method, which returns a copy of the array in a 1D format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also do the opposite and increase the rank of an array by reshaping it. For example, we can reshape a 1D array into a 2D array with one column or one row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcasting\nCombining arrays of different shapes is possible in NumPy using a feature called broadcasting. Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can reshape a 1D array to a column or row vector and use broadcasting to expand it into a large table. For example, to create a table where each row is the original 1D array, or each column is the original array:",

For example, they are essential in computer graphics for transformations, in machine learning for optimization, and in physics for solving systems of equations.

This can be useful for creating masks or selecting specific regions of the matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative function is imshow, which is more general and can be used for both 2D arrays and images.\nHere we can set the origin of the axis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference between matshow and imshow is that matshow is specifically designed for displaying matrices, while imshow is more general and can be used for both 2D arrays and images. matshow automatically adjusts the aspect ratio to make the matrix square, while imshow does not. Also the interpolation method used by matshow is different from that used by imshow, which can affect the appearance of the image.\nImages are represneted as 3d arays: every entry is a the intensity of a pixel (if the image is grayscale) or the intensity of a colour (e.g. red, green or blue) if the image is in colour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a colour image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is no longer just a 2d array, it has a third dimension for the colour channels (red, green, blue). We can access the individual colour channels by slicing the array along the third dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can slice the array to get the various channels (notice that we specify the colormap cmap argument to display the channels in the appropriate colour):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to subsample regions of an image, we can simply slice the array further in its rows and columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use boolean indexing to filter the image based on conditions.\nFor example, we can binarise it by applying a threshold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can even perform logical operations using numpy\n\nAND with &\nOR with |\nNOT with ~ or np.logical_not",

    "text": "One application for using a geometrical mask, like you have been developing, is when looking at images containing real objects like galaxies. In this case we have accessed a galaxy image as a png file. In reality, there are more specific file formats traditionally used to store this type of astronomical data but the principle is similar.\nWe can open the image of the galaxy using the following code. This uses a module called pillow (imported as PIL) which understands how to read image files and we can import the Image sub-module to open this file. We can convert that image into a numpy array object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the shape of this image data we can see that is is 3D - it has height and width but also three entries for colour: Red, Green and Blue (RGB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did when plotting the mask, we can use a matplotlib function called imshow() to display this image, but this time it knows how to interpret the three colour channels to display an image with colour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is sprial galaxy NGC 253, also known as the Sculpter Galaxy. If we wanted to mask this image so that only the pixels related to the galaxy remain, we can do so using a geometrical mask for an ellipse - similiar to the circular mask you have been developing but with a few additional parameters needed.\n\n\n\nThe inside_ellipse function defined below will allow you to check whether an (x, y) value is inside an ellipse with the supplied parameters. As we’ve seen in previous weeks, functions can be used to avoid having to repeat code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the parameters that can be passed to the inside_ellipse() function we need to consider the form of an ellipse. The equation govering the edge of an ellipse is similiar to a circle but instead of one radius, \\(r\\), there are now two parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) defined as the semi-major and semi-minor axes (naming can be the other way round depending on which is larger).\nFor an ellipse centred at (\\(x_{0}\\), \\(y_{0}\\)) and with the semi-major axis parallel to the x-axis the equation of the edge of the ellipse would be:\n\\[ \\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-y_0)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\]\nThis would look something like:\n\nHowever, for our example we also need to consider an ellipse at an angle away from the x-axis, alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)).

    "text": "How can we use what we have learnt in the past few workshops to read data from a file? And how can we plot this?\nOne way to then plot this data would be to extract the index and/or multiple columns we are interested in plotting and use matplotlib as we have done before.\nAs an example, we’ll look at a new data file. This contains a simulation of the (fractional) concentration change for two species in a reaction, “A” and “B” where \\(A \\rightarrow B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we open this file more directly in Python when we looked at a text file) we can take quick look at the contents to see what this looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom printing out the first 200 characters, we can see this looks like a table of data with each column separated by spaces. This looks nicely formatted with a title row including the column names and no extra header rows.\nWe will see in the next year that there are dedicate packages to manipulate large tabulated files. However, for now we can exploit numpy as a quick and effective way to read such input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a special kind of array called a structured array, because it has named fields. You can check this by querying the subproperties of the array:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese various names are the fields of the array, corresponding to the columns in the file. This syntax is reminiscent of what we have seen in the case of dictionaries, where keys are used to specific other objects stored in the dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data also has a column for “Time” as the number of seconds elapsed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a plot for time vs concentration of A, we can extract this data from our array\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could then use matplotlib to plot this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simulation shows a clean relationship as concentration decreases over time (in an exponential way).\nSuppose we want to filter our data and plot only concentrations less than 0.5. We can simply create a boolean array that masks the invalid data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have filtered our data to include all fractional concentrations less than (or equal to) 0.5. Notice we have also matched our time values to plot to these concentrations by extracting the index from our new array concentration_A_low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see the slope is similiar (in fact it is the same) between our unfiltered and filtered data (this is due to the exponential relationship).\n\n\nExercise\n\nRe-plot the un-filtered graph created above and add another line to show concentration of B vs time from the data_kinetic_k0005 array on the same plot.\n\n\nCan you include a label for A and B?\n\n\nCalculate the the sum of the concentrations for these two columns (A and B).\nRe-plot the graph created in the previous question and add this sum as a third line.\n\n\nConsider: What does this sum tell us about “A” is decaying into “B”?",

    "text": "Array indexing, slicing, views and copies\nIndexing in NumPy allows you to access and modify individual elements or groups of elements within an array. You can use integer indices, slices, and even boolean arrays to select data efficiently. For example:\n\nInteger Indexing: Select a single element by its position.\nSlicing: Extract a range of elements.\nBoolean Indexing: Filter elements based on a condition.\n\n\nInteger indexing\nWe have already seen that the lements of an array are idnexed similarly to lists. The syntax simply requires you to enter the integer index of the element you want to access. For example, if you have an array arr, you can access the element at index 1 using arr[1]. You can also slice arrays using the same syntax as lists, such as arr[1:4] to get elements from index 1 to 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicing\nSlicing allows you to extract a portion of an array by specifying a start index, an end index, and an optional step. The syntax is similar to that used for lists in Python. For example, arr[1:4] retrieves elements from index 1 to 3 (the end index is exclusive).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Slicing Techniques\nNumPy slicing can be extended beyond basic start and end indices:\n\nStep Size: Use a third parameter to specify the step, e.g., arr[::2] selects every other element.\nNegative Indices: Negative values index from the end, e.g., arr[-3:] gets the last three elements.\nReverse Slicing: Use a negative step to reverse an array, e.g., arr[::-1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicing creates views, not copies, so modifying a slice affects the original array. Use arr.copy() to create a copy if needed.\nA view is a new array object that looks at the same data as the original array. Changes made to a view will affect the original array, since they share the same underlying data. For example, arr[1:4] returns a view of arr, not a separate copy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlices can be programmaticaly generated using the slice function, which allows you to create a slice object that can be reused. For example, s = slice(1, 4) creates a slice object that can be used as arr[s] to get the same result as arr[1:4].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create an independent copy of an array (rather than a view), use the copy() method. For example, arr_copy = arr[1:4].copy() creates a new array with its own data, so changes to arr_copy will not affect the original arr. This is useful when you want to modify a subset of an array without altering the original data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean Indexing\nBoolean indexing allows you to select elements from an array based on a condition. When you apply a condition to a NumPy array, it returns a boolean (an array that contains only True/False values ) array indicating which elements satisfy the condition. You can then use this boolean array to filter the original array, extracting only the elements that meet the criteria. This technique is powerful for data selection and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing np.where for conditional selection\nThe np.where function in NumPy is a powerful tool for conditional selection and element-wise operations. It allows you to choose values from arrays based on a condition, returning indices or constructing new arrays.\n\nBasic usage:\nnp.where(condition) returns the indices where the condition is True.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnp.where(arr &gt; threshold) returns a tuple because, for 1D arrays, it provides the indices where the condition is True. In NumPy, the output is always a tuple of arrays—one for each dimension of the input array. For a 1D array, it’s a single-element tuple containing the indices. For higher dimensions, it returns a tuple with arrays for each axis. This consistent tuple format makes it easy to handle multi-dimensional indexing.\nSo, for 1D arrays as the ones considered up to now, we should get the indices by extracting the first element of the tuple returned by np.where\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement-wise selection:\nnp.where(condition, x, y) returns elements from x where the condition is True, and from y where it is False. Here the result is an array of the same shape as x and y, containing values from x where the condition is met, and from y otherwise. This is useful for creating new arrays based on conditions without using loops.",

    "section": "Random Data Generation",
    "text": "Random Data Generation\nRandom data generation is essential for simulations, statistical modeling, and testing algorithms.\nFor example, you might want to generate random samples from a normal distribution to simulate real-world data or create random datasets for testing purposes. Or you may want to simulate the effect of measurement errors in your data analysis. Or you may want to sub-sample a large dataset randomly to take a representative sample without bias.\nTo do all this, one needs methods to sample numbers that possess the statistical properties of the desired distribution, such as uniform, normal, or binomial distributions.\nStrictly speaking (classical) computers are deterministic machines, meaning they follow a set of rules and produce the same output for the same input every time. We have therefore to use algorithms to produce sequences of numbers that mimic the properties of random numbers.\nThese are called pseudo-random numbers. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) use algorithms to produce sequences of numbers that appear random but are actually deterministic.\nA simple and classic example of a pseudo-random number generator is the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). The LCG produces a sequence of numbers using the recurrence relation:\n\\[x_{n+1} = (a \\times  x_{n} + c)\\,\\mathrm{mod}\\, m\\]\nwhere\n- \\(x_n\\) is the current value,\n- \\(a\\) is the multiplier,\n- \\(c\\) is the increment,\n- \\(m\\) is the modulus.\nIn vanilla Python this looks like the following custom function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will generate a sequence of pseudo-random integers. The choice of parameters (a, c, m) affects the quality and period of the generator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed is crucial: it is the initial value that starts the algorithm to determin the subsequent values in the sequence. By setting the seed, you can ensure that the sequence is reproducible, meaning that running the same code with the same seed will produce the same sequence of numbers every time.\nIn numpy, we do not need to implement our own LCG, as it provides a built-in random number generator that is based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a widely used and efficient pseudo-random numbwer generator.\nWhat we do instead is to use the numpy.random sub-module, which provides a wide range of functions for generating random numbers from various distributions, including uniform, normal, and binomial distributions.\nThe standard way to to use it is the following:\n\nfirst, one initialises a new kind of object called a random number generator (RNG) using np.random.default_rng(). This is a numpy object capable of generating random numbers from various distributions. It allows us in particular to set the seed and therefore ensure reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this at any point in our code, but it is a good practice to do it at the beginning of our script or notebook, so that we can ensure that all random numbers generated in the script are reproducible. Putting the generator elsewhere (for example, inside a function) could lead to unexpected results, as the generator would be re-initialised each time the function is called.\nOnce we have a generator we can access any of its method to sample numbers from various distributions\nFor example:\n\nIntegers\nTo sample uniformly distributed integers, we can use the integers method of the generator. This method allows us to specify a range and the number of integers to generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0-1) uniform floats\nTo sample uniformly distributed floats between 0 and 1, we can use the random method of the generator. This method generates random floats in the range [0.0, 1.0) (which means 0 included and 1 excluded).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use the uniform method to sample uniformly distributed floats in a specified range. This method allows us to specify the lower and upper bounds of the range, as well as the number of samples to generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal distribution\nTo sample from a normal distribution, we can use the normal method of the generator. This method allows us to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, as well as the number of samples to generate. The generated samples will follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution with the specified parameters.",

This will return a single value sampled from the specified distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this can sometimes be more computationally costly than generating a larger sample and then selecting a single value from it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good example of the tradeoff between memory usage and computational efficiency: in modern machines, memory is quite cheap, so it is often more efficient to preallocate a larger array and then sample from it, rather than generating a single value at a time.\nA good size for preallocated numbers depends on your use case and available memory. Typical choices are:\n\nSmall tasks: 100 to 1,000 elements\nMedium tasks: 10,000 to 100,000 elements\nLarge tasks: 1,000,000 or more elements\n\nFor most data analysis or simulation tasks, starting with 100,000 elements is practical and efficient. Always ensure the size fits within your system’s memory limits.",

A passenger is seated in a car at the edge of the wheel. Calculate the trajectory of the passenger with respect to the center of the wheel for the duration of 30 seconds, with a time resolution of 2 seconds, assuming they start at the rightmost point of the wheel.\n\nThe problem is a two-dimensional problem. The passenger has coordinates \\(x(t), y(t)\\) and is performing uniform rotational motion, with angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) and radius \\(R\\).\nThe angle formed at which the passenger is located is \\(\\theta(t)\\) and simply evolves as\n\\[\\theta(t) = \\omega t +\\theta_0\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle (\\(\\theta_0=0\\) in our case).\nHence, the trajectory is expressed by\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx(t) & = R\\cos\\theta(t) = R \\cos{\\omega t}+x_0\\\\\ny(t) & = R\\sin\\theta(t)  = R \\sin{\\omega t}+y_0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, we have all the theoretical knowledge that we need to solve the problem.

The only difficult parts are determining the order of operations for the third example (python will interpret this as True or (False and False) rather than (True or False) and False) and the xor (^) on the fourth line.\nQuestion 8: The error in the code occurs when float(x + y) is run.\nWhen x and y are numeric, the + symbol is interpreted as addition and the result is cast to a float (e.g. if x=1 and y=5 as in the first example then x+y yeilds 6). However, if they are instead strings (as in the second example), then the + symbol is interpreted as concatenation rather than addition. Therefore, when x='2' and y='5', we get that 2+5 yeilds 25, not 7.\nThere are two approaches to resolving the issue. The first is to replace x='2' and y='5' with x=2 and y=5. The second, and preferred option, is to replace float(x + y) with float(x)+float(y) so there is no possibility that the + symbol is interpreted as concatenation here.\nQuestion 9: The first box is an assignment of the value 2 + 1 to a variable named three, so does not print anything. The second box prints true as the variable z = (1 + 2 == 3) is interpreted as a Boolean variable, and in Jupyter notebooks, if the last line of a box is simply a variable, with no assignment, then that variable is printed out. z is evaluated as True (as 1 + 2 does equal 3 in Python), so True is printed.\nFor the third box, False is printed as due to rounding errors 0.1 + 0.2 is evaluated to 0.30000000000000004 rather than 0.3. This is a cautionary note that floating point math is not perfect.\nQuestion 10: The final solution is given below:"

In Python lists are written with square brackets.\n\nwhere changeable means that once created, the elements of the list can be modified, added, or removed, while the elements of a tuple cannot be altered after creation.\nBoth tuples and lists are built-in data types, can hold elements of arbitrary datatypes and behave, in many respects, like mathematical vectors. However, for numerical vectors and arrays it is much better to use numpy arrays, which are covered later in the course.\nBelow are some examples of lists and tuples. Note again that lists and tuples can contain data of any type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means they can also be nested. I.e. we can put a list in a list, a tuple in a tuple, a list in a tuple and a tuple in a list!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding to Lists and Tuples\nLists and tuples can be added to using the concatenation operator, +, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexing Lists and Tuples\nTo index in python, square brackets are used. This is a common convention which applies to almost all vector-like datatypes in Python, e.g. tuples, lists, strings, numpy arrays, etc.\nPython uses zero indexing, which means that the first element in a list of length n is indexed as 0 and the last element is indexed as n-1. For example see the below (note that the same can also be done for tuples):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative numbers can also be used to index lists (and other similar datatypes). For example, the index -1 will give the last element of the list, the index -2 will give the second to last element of the list and so on. This is known as circular wrap-around.\nFor a list of length n any index can be used between -n and (n-1) (inclusive) to access elements in the list. Indices outside of this range, however, will give an “index out of range” error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that nested lists and tuples support nested indexing but this involve multiple sets of square brackets (for example see below).\nYou may be more familiar with indexing of the form example_list[a,b] (i.e. only one set of square brackets); this syntax does exist in Python but unfortunately not for lists. In fact, this syntax is used heavily by numpy arrays (which we will cover later in the course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicing Tuples and Lists\nA range of index values can be specified to extract values from a list using a colon, :. This way of accessing data is known as slicing and can be performed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Often, in other languages such as Matlab the syntax 0:3 represents the range [0,1,2,3]; however, in python 0:3 represents only [0,1,2]. In other words the syntax k:n includes [k,k+1,...n-1] but does not include n itself! This is common to all data types in python and should always be remembered when indexing anything in Python!\n\nWhen indexing in python you can leave the start and end values implicit. This will give the same effect as starting from the beginning of the list and ending at the end of the list. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also indicate a step size when indexing by using the following syntax:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you can run backwards through the list by using negative integers as the step size. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations on Lists and Tuples\nOther operations are also available for lists and tuples. Most notably, the * symbol can be used to replicate a list or tuple like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther notable operations for lists include:\n\ninsert: This function adds an element to the list at a specified position.\npop: This function removes the element in the list at the specified position.\nremove: This function removes the item with the specified value from the list.\nreverse: This function reverses the order of the list.\nsort: This function sorts the list.\n\nA few examples of these functions are given below. Try changing and editing the below code to check your understanding! Again, this is by no means a comprehensive list; more information can be found in the Python API or in the W3 schools documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot as many operations are available for tuples as tuples are immutable (not meant to change in value). Two available operations are:\n\ncount: This function returns the number of times a specified value occurs in the tuple.\nindex: This function searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.\n\nExamples of these are given below. For more information on tuples please visit the Python API or the W3 schools documentation.",

    "text": "Sets and Dictionarys\nIn this section, we are going to look in more detail at Sets and Dictionarys.\n\nA set is a collection which is unordered, changeable and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.\nA dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionarys are also written with curly brackets but also with keys and values.\n\nLike tuples and lists, both sets and dictionarys are built-in python types and can hold elements of arbitrary data types. However, unlike tuples and lists they do not behave like vectors as they are unordered. In other programming languages, such as Java, you may have heard of dictionarys referred to as hashmaps.\nBelow are some examples of sets and dictionarys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding elements to and retreiving elements from Dictionarys\nElements can be added to dictionarys as keys and values. For example; in the first line below the key is a and the value is b. Note that a key does not have to be a string; integers and floats work just as well. Values can be of any data type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then retreive values from the dictionary using the keys we stored them under. This can be done with either square brackets or the built-in get function. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving elements from a dictionary\nElements can be removed from a dictionary using the pop and del methods. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations on Dictionarys\nOther operations are also available for dictionarys. Some of the most useful of these are;\n\nkeys: This function returns a list containing the dictionary’s keys.\nvalues: This function returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.\nitems: This function returns a list containing a tuple for each (key, value) pair.\n\nExamples of these functions are given below. For full documentation and details on more functions see the Python API and W3 schools Python documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding elements to a set\nElements can be added to a set using the add function. For example, see the below code.\nNote that a set is designed to mimic the idea of a set in mathematics and, therefore, sets do not allow for duplicate entries. An entry is either in or not in a set; it cannot be “in” a set twice.\nMultiple elements can also be added to a set at once using the update method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no notion of indexing for Python sets as sets are unordered. This means that individual elements cannot be accessed in the same manor as in dictionarys, lists and tuples. We can check if an element is in a set, however, using the in keyword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving elements from a set\nElements can be removed from a set using the remove function. Note: the remove function will errror if the requested value is not in the set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations on Sets\nOther operations are also available for sets, many of which are designed to mimic mathematic functions. For example:\n\ndifference: This function returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets.\nintersection: This function returns a set which is the intersection of two other sets.\nissubset: This function returns True if the first set input contains the second set input and False otherwise.\nissuperset: This function returns True if the first set input is contained within the second set input and False otherwise.\nunion: This function returns a set containing the union of input sets.\n\nExamples of these are given below. For full documentation and details on more functions see the Python API and W3 schools Python documentation.",

    "section": "Beginner: Basic Data Types",
    "text": "Beginner: Basic Data Types\nQuestion 1: The solution to the question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The purpose of this question is to prompt students to think about the use of the and and or boolean operators, as well as the syntax for &lt;. When advising students on this question, make sure to help them break the inequalities \\(x^2&lt;y&lt;z^3\\) and \\(z^3&lt;y&lt;x^2\\) down using the and statement.\n\nQuestion 2: The solution to the question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Last year, many of the students struggled with Boolean logic. This question aims to get them thinking about how to combine logical connectives like and and not. If students are struggling with this, please try and prompt them to convert the natural language sentence it's raining and I don't have my umbrella to logical syntax by breaking it down into smaller sentences. Highlight that I don't have my umbrella is the logical opposite (negation) of I have my umbrella.\n\nQuestion 3: The completed truth table for this question is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nA and B\nnot C\n(A and B) or (not C)\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n\nAnd the code for this question is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is again designed to get students thinking about Boolean logic. It is expected that, for many students, this will be their first encounter with truth tables and first-order logical operators.\nIf a student is struggling with the abstraction, try to relate A, B and C to the example given in the slides. In the slides, A represents the statement The cat is black and B represents the statement The cat has four legs. To extend the example, you could define C to be, for instance, The cat has blue eyes. Once this is understood, try building the truth table column by column, starting with the A and B column, then the not C column and then finally the (A and B) or (not C) column.\nWhen giving examples, try to avoid statements with vague/ambiguous truth values. For instance, The cat is tall has an ambiguous truth value as there is not a clear distinction between tall and not tall.\n\nQuestion 4: The solution to this question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: At this stage, students will not know any numpy, so please make sure to use x**(1/2) instead of functions such as np.sqrt(x). These functions will be taught at a later stage. It is expected that many students here will mistakenly write ^ for exponentiation instead of **, so please look out for this mistake. Some students may also need reminding that Pythagoras’ theorem can be used to compute the length of the diagonal.\n\nQuestion 5: The solution to this question is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Whilst the SUVAT equations are part of the UK A-level Physics syllabus, please be aware that many students may not know them. For instance, data science or chemistry students may not have taken Physics A-level (or potentially even GCSE) and overseas students may have been taught the subject using different notations. For this reason, be aware students may be non-responsive to this question because they do not understand that, e.g., a should be set to 9.81. Try to assess whether the student is comfortable with the subject material before giving advice on how to solve the problem here.\n\nQuestion 6: The solution to this question is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: See comments on previous question. Also be aware that there are multiple solutions to this question, as any of the equations \\(v=u+at\\), \\(s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^2\\) or \\(s=\\frac{(u+v)t}{2}\\) can be used. Students who are unsure what to do should be encouraged to look at the linked document for question 5.\n\nQuestion 7: A code block containing the examples from the question is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answers follow by standard boolean logic. The only difficult parts are determining the order of operations for the third example (python will interpret this as True or (False and False) rather than (True or False) and False) and the xor (^) on the fourth line.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Some students may find this question confusing because we are using the Boolean values True and False directly, rather than naming them as variables (e.g. A and B). Emphasize that there is no difference between the below code:\nA = True\nB = False\nprint(A and B)\nand this code:\nprint(True and False)\nThe logic is identical - the only change is whether we use named variables or literal values. Point this out clearly so students see that the rules of Boolean logic still apply in exactly the same way.\n\nQuestion 8: The error in the code occurs when float(x + y) is run.\nWhen x and y are numeric, the + symbol is interpreted as addition and the result is cast to a float (e.g. if x=1 and y=5 as in the first example then x+y yeilds 6). However, if they are instead strings (as in the second example), then the + symbol is interpreted as concatenation rather than addition. Therefore, when x='2' and y='5', we get that 2+5 yeilds 25, not 7.\nThere are two approaches to resolving the issue. The first is to replace x='2' and y='5' with x=2 and y=5. The second, and preferred option, is to replace float(x + y) with float(x)+float(y) so there is no possibility that the + symbol is interpreted as concatenation here.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: If students are struggling with this question, suggest that they search the document for the + symbol and make sure they understand how it is being used. Hint that the symbol might not be interpreted in the way they first expect, but avoid giving away the full answer unless they are really stuck. The aim is to guide them toward discovering the behaviour themselves.\n\nQuestion 9: The first box is an assignment of the value 2 + 1 to a variable named three, so does not print anything. The second box prints true as the variable z = (1 + 2 == 3) is interpreted as a Boolean variable, and in Jupyter notebooks, if the last line of a box is simply a variable, with no assignment, then that variable is printed out. z is evaluated as True (as 1 + 2 does equal 3 in Python), so True is printed.\nFor the third box, False is printed as due to rounding errors 0.1 + 0.2 is evaluated to 0.30000000000000004 rather than 0.3. This is a cautionary note that floating point math is not perfect.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: First, it aims to get students to think about the difference between the assignment operator = and the equality operator ==. Second, it serves as a cautionary note about floating point arithmetic in Python.\nAfter seeing the result, many students may ask how to properly check whether 0.1 + 0.2 equals 0.3. For now, explain that we will cover this in more detail when we look at numpy. If they push further, encourage them to think about constructing a Boolean expression (similar to Question 1) that checks whether two numbers differ by only a very small amount. The aim here is to prepare them for the np.allclose function later on, while prompting them to reason about the problem themselves rather than being given the solution straight away.\n\nQuestion 10: The final solution is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is designed to give students practice with the string replace function. Encourage them to experiment and work through the task step by step, even if their first attempt doesn’t work. The key learning outcome is to get comfortable with testing, adjusting, and trying again - it aims to enforce good programming habits."

Common errors to look out for include failing to account for the fact Python uses zero indexing, or that slicing syntax such as nums[:3] doesn’t include nums[3] in the output, only nums[0],nums[1] and nums[2].\n\nQuestion 2: The key to this question is that a list is ordered whilst a set is unordered. When the list is converted to a set, it’s ordering is lost, and when converted back to a list it is now given in increasing (numerical) order by default.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: Hopefully, this should not be a difficult question. Encourage students who are struggling to print out my_set and my_list and describe what is different between them.\n\nQuestion 3: The answer to this question is the letter k. To see this, the below code can be used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question brings together concepts from both the Beginner and Intermediate notebooks, making it a good checkpoint to assess whether students are ready to move into the Intermediate material.\nIf students are struggling, suggest that they try the task on paper first. They will probably start by writing out the letters from each sentence and then comparing the two sets of letters. From there, you can show how Python supports the same process by turning a string into a list of characters and then using the set constructor to remove duplicates. This should hopefully help them connect the manual approach with the Python solution.\nOnce they have these concepts down, encourage students to think about why the lower() function (as suggested in the hint) is useful here. It ensures that comparisons between characters are case-insensitive.\n\nQuestion 4: The code for this question is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: See notes on Question 1.\n\nQuestion 5: There are many ways to approach this question. Two examples are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to help students recognise that there are multiple valid ways to represent the same dataset in Python. The important part is thinking about how the data will be used. For example, if we need to look up information by subject name, a dictionary of dictionaries might be best; if we want to work with all weights at once (e.g. to build a histogram), a dictionary of lists is more convenient. Emphasise that the choice of data structure depends on the task - there isn’t one ‘right’ answer."

    "text": "Advanced: Copying and References\n\nBroad Notes for Demonstrators: If you see a student attempting the intermediate or advanced questions who does not seem at the level of the material, please do encourage them to first try the earlier notebooks.\n\nQuestion 1: The expected output is [1,2,3,4]. This is because list_a and list_b reference the same location in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to get students to recognise that lists are mutable. As a list is mutable, both list_a and list_b refer to the same underlying object in memory. When we do list_b = list_a, we are not creating a copy of the list, but simply creating a new reference to the same list object. Therefore, when we perform list_a.append(4), the change is reflected in both list_a and list_b. Encourage students to think about how they could gain the desired behaviour using the .copy() function (e.g. list_b = list_a.copy()).\n\nQuestion 2: Code A will print [1,2,3] whilst Code B will print [4,5,6]. This is because, when we replace a with [4,5,6] we change the reference to point to a new location in memory, breaking the connection between a and b. However, when we change the elements in a individually, both a and b remain pointing to the same location in memory. Thus, when we print b, we get [4,5,6].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: See notes for Question 1.\n\nQuestion 3: The variable names xyz and xyzsquared are pointing to the same array. When we squared xyzsquared we also squared xyz. We could have avoided this by making xyzsquared a seperate copy of xyz using the list constructor like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrator Notes: This question is designed to give students practice debugging code. Try to guide them to the solution where possible, rather than providing the full solution straight away.\n\nQuestion 4: When you do backup = list(grid), Python only makes a new outer list. The smaller lists inside ([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]) are still the exact same objects that grid is using. Because of that, if you change one of the inner lists, the same change shows up backup.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: The aim of this question is to understand why the unexpected behaviour occured. If students ask how to fix this, that’s a natural question, but at this stage they don’t yet have the tools to do so. For now, keep the focus on helping them understand why the behaviour occurs, instead of talking about fixes at this stage.\n\nQuestion 5: The reasoning for this question is similar to that of Question 4, but noting that the three inner lists are all pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nDemonstrator Notes: See the notes for Question 4."
