## Things to change/improve



- Give more room to numpy syntax (1d and more?)
  - indexing and slicing during the lectures
  - boolean selection and operations
  - maybe linear algebra
- Tom thinks he can reshape the first three weeks with a simple but tricky project 1
  - Week 1: Course structure and elementary data types
  - Week 2: Logic and branching 
  - Week 3: Iterables and loops
  - Week 4: Functions (merging a bit of week 13, no *functions* as first-class  objects)
  - Week 5: Consolidation [ how is it relevant to my degree?]
  - Week 6: Revision week
  - Week 7: Intro to numpy
  - Week 8: Indexing and random numbers
  - Week 9:Introduction to matplotlib
  - Week 10: Two-dimensional arrays and basic algebra
  - Week 11: Consolidation 
  - Week 13: (Currently off-topic)  Pandas series and data frames
  - Week 14: Pre-processing data frames
  - Week 15: Plotting with Pandas
  - Week 16: Advanced plotting
  - Week 17: Pandas vs numpy
  - Same for the rest...
  - More signposting of Project 4
- Project 1 should test:



## Alternatives implementation plan



- First five weeks are rewritten by Tom in a more complete way
- A proper numpy 2-hour introduction in week 7 shift the rest of content of TB1 with the elimination of  "Consolidation basics and numpy"
- Week 13 is I/O
- And week 19 is Pandas vs Numpy
