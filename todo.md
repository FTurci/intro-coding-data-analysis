## Things to change/improve



- Give more room to numpy syntax (1d and more?)
  - indexing and slicing during the lectures
  - boolean selection and operations
  - maybe linear algebra
- Tom thinks he can reshape the first three weeks with a simple but tricky project 1
  - Week 1: Course structure and elementary data types
  - Week 2: Logic and branching 
  - Week 3: Iterables and loops
  - Week 4: Functions (merging a bit of week 13, no *functions* as first-class  objects)
  - Week 5: Consolidation [ how is it relevant to my degree?]
  - Week 6: Revision week
  - Week 7: Intro to numpy
  - Week 8: Indexing and random numbers
  - Week 9:Introduction to matplotlib
  - Week 10: Two-dimensional arrays and basic algebra
  - Week 11: Consolidation 
  - Week 13: (Currently off-topic)  Pandas series and data frames
  - Week 14: Pre-processing data frames
  - Week 15: Plotting with Pandas
  - Week 16: Advanced plotting
  - Week 17: Pandas vs numpy
  - Same for the rest...
  - More signposting of Project 4
- Project 1 should test:



## Alternative implementation plan



- First five weeks are rewritten by Tom in a more complete way
- A proper numpy 2-hour introduction in week 7 
- shift the rest of content of TB1 with the elimination of  "Consolidation basics and numpy"
- Week 13 is I/O
- And week 19 is Pandas vs Numpy

## Update 23rd June 2025

Taking all this into consideration, the sequence could look like (I am rewriting the above with some details and the rest of the weeks as well)



1. Course Structure (use of Noteable/Nature of the Workshops/Nature of the Tutorials/Assessments) - Basic data types (numericals, strings, lists, tuples)

2. Logic (using and combining boolean variables) and Branching

3. Iterables and loops (revisit the lists in more details and introduce for and while loops)

4. Organising code in functions

5. Consolidation material with examples from data science, chemistry and physics (one simple example each)

6.    --- Revision ---

6. Introduction to numpy: operations with one-dimensional arrays

7. Working with arrays: indexing and generation of (random) data (includes boolean arrays, generation of sequences with np.arange and np.linspace, generation of random samples the random number generator in numpy) 

8. Introduction to matplotlib (plotting curves,  labelling, legends, customisation)

9. Two-dimensional arrays in numpy (images, masks and basic linear algebra up to matrix multiplication)

10. Consolidation
    --- Winter Break---

11. Pandas series and data frames

12. Pre-processing data frames (cleaning, filtering, querying )

13. Plotting with Pandas (tie together Pandas and matplotlib, using the dataframe paradigm when possible. Glimpse of seaborne)

14. Pandas vs numpy (inter-communication between the two modules, differences in slicing and glimpse on functions used as first-class objects by pandas'apply )

15. Writing scientific reports (preparation for final assignment. The message gets reiterated in the tutorials in small groups)
    
16.    --- Revision

16. Curve fitting (polynomial fits with numpy)

17. Introduction to software engineering 

18. Consolidation

19. Drop-in session
