## Today's Material

In today's class, we shall focus on loops. As in the previous two classes, this week you have a choice of working through one of three notebooks.

> **Important:** For today, please **choose just one of the options below**. You’ll have many opportunities to revisit the other concepts later in the course, so focus on building confidence with the Beginner material before tackling more advanced work.

#### Option 1: Beginner

If you have not spent much time coding in Python prior to taking this course, today you should work through the `for` and `while` loops notebook linked below:

- [Beginner: For and While Loops](./week_03_loops_beginner.qmd)

This notebook will talk you through the basics of loops in Python. Please read through the text carefully and attempt all exercises!

#### Option 2: Intermediate

This weeks intermediate notebook should only be taken by those who are very comfortable with the material in the [beginner](./week_03_loops_beginner.qmd) notebook. Please ensure that you are able to complete the exercises in the [beginner](./week_03_loops_beginner.qmd) notebook before attempting this option. The intermediate material for this week is given below:

 - [Intermediate: Advanced Iteration](./week_03_loops_intermediate.qmd)

This notebook will guide you through more advanced loop syntax such as iteration over dictionaries and the `zip` function.

#### Option 3: Advanced

If you are an experienced programmer with a strong grasp of Python, begin by reviewing the exercises in the notebooks below to ensure you are fully comfortable with the material:

- [Beginner: For and While Loops](./week_03_loops_beginner.qmd)  
- [Intermediate: Advanced Iteration](./week_03_loops_intermediate.qmd)

Once you are confident in your understanding, move on to the following notebook:

- [Advanced: Comprehensions](./week_03_loops_advanced.qmd)

This will introduce you to list, set, dict and generator comprehensions, and explain how they can be combined with conditional expressions. Please only attempt this notebook if you have a strong background in Python programming.

## Getting Help

There is a lot to remember when first learning Python. To get more help see the [Python API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Another useful link is the [W3 schools series on Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) which is very good, especially for new users. Another way to get help if you are ever unsure what a function is doing is to use the`help` function in the Python terminal like so:

```{pyodide}
#| caption: "▶ Ctrl/Cmd+Enter | ⇥ Ctrl/Cmd+] | ⇤ Ctrl/Cmd+["
#| scrolled: true
help(print)
```

In class, you can ask for help from the lecturer, demonstrators and your peers around you. We advise you do not ask AI for help unless you are really stuck.
