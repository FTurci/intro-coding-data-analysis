   - Recap: The Course So Far
   - Tackling Difficult Problems
   - A Worked Example
   - Practical

## Recap: The Course So Far

 - Over the last 4 weeks, we've covered the basics of Python
 - We've looked at:
    - Datatypes
    - Conditional Logic
    - Loops
    - Functions

```{pyodide}

# -----------------------------------
# Data Types
# -----------------------------------
x= 7         # an integer 
y= "hello"   # a string of text 
z= True      # a boolean (true/false) 
# -----------------------------------


# -----------------------------------
# Conditional Statements
# -----------------------------------
number = 5

my_boolean = number > 0

if my_boolean:
    print("Positive number")
# -----------------------------------


# -----------------------------------
# While Loops
# -----------------------------------
number = 5

my_boolean = number > 0

while my_boolean:
    number = number - 1
    my_boolean = number > 0
    print("number is " + str(number))
# -----------------------------------


# -----------------------------------
# For Loops
# -----------------------------------
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for n in numbers:
    print(n)
# -----------------------------------


# -----------------------------------
# Functions
# -----------------------------------
# This is a function:
def print_double_and_add_one(x):
    # Double x and add 1
    y = x * 2 + 1
    print(y)
# -----------------------------------
```

## Recap: The Course So Far

 - Before moving on to the next parts of the course...
    - `NumPy`, `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`
 - ... this week we are going to do some "consolidation challenges"
    - Using what we have learnt to tackle the kinds of tasks you might encounter in the real world

## Aside: Dictionaries

 - Before we dive into today's work, there is one concept we'd like to revisit in more detail
 - A dictionary, or `dict`, is a data type in Python
   - It allows us to store `value`s under `key`s
 - Think of a real-life dictionary
   - You look up a word (the `key`)
   - You read its definition (the `value`)
 - In the same way, a Python `dict` lets you
   - You look up a `key`
   - Get back the `value` associated with it

```{pyodide}
#| caption: "▶ Ctrl/Cmd+Enter | ⇥ Ctrl/Cmd+] | ⇤ Ctrl/Cmd+["
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
# Define a dictionary with two key-value pairs
my_dict = {
    "apple": "a sweet red or green fruit",
    "book": "a set of written or printed pages bound together"
}

# Look up the value for the key 'apple'
print(my_dict["apple"])
```

## Aside: Dictionaries

 - New values can be added to the dictionary using the syntax

   - `my_dict[key] = value`

```{pyodide}
#| caption: "▶ Ctrl/Cmd+Enter | ⇥ Ctrl/Cmd+] | ⇤ Ctrl/Cmd+["
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
# Existing dictionary
my_dict = {
    "apple": "a sweet red or green fruit",
    "book": "a set of written or printed pages bound together"
}

# Add a new key-value pair
my_dict["chair"] = "a piece of furniture for sitting"

# Print the value for the key 'chair'
print(my_dict["chair"])
```

## Aside: Dictionaries

 - And keys and values can be any datatype you like 

   - They don't have to be strings!

```{pyodide}
#| caption: "▶ Ctrl/Cmd+Enter | ⇥ Ctrl/Cmd+] | ⇤ Ctrl/Cmd+["
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
# Dictionary with different key and value types
my_dict = {
    1: "one",
    "fruit": ["apple", "banana", "cherry"],
    3.14: "pi"
}

# Print the value for the key "fruit"
print(my_dict["fruit"])

# Print the value for the key 3.14
print(my_dict[3.14])
```

## Aside: Dictionaries

 - Dictionaries will be crucial to some of today's challenges as well as throughout the rest of this course
 - If you are unsure about these please take the time to read over:

   - `Week 1's intermediate notebook`
     `Section: Sets and Dictionaries`
 - You can do this either in today's class or over the week 6 break

## Tackling Difficult Problems

 - Today, we're going to be looking at some challenge problems
 - These problems may feel a little more open-ended than you are used to
   - This can be a little daunting at first
   - But do not worry...
   - You already have all the skills necessary to complete the tasks!
 - When faced with a difficult coding problem, here's some general tips to help you get started out

## Tackling Difficult Problems

 - **Plan before you code**

   - Before you start coding, grab a pen and paper and try to solve the problem by hand!

 - **Clarify inputs and outputs**

   - When getting started think about what you have and what you need – these are probably your inputs and outputs
 - **Look for structure and repetition**

   - When you convert your thoughts to code, ask yourself which parts of the code are repetitive or self-contained

## Tackling Difficult Problems

 - **Divide and Conquer**

   - Try to break the task down into smaller chunks where possible!
 - **Talk things through**

   - If you are struggling to get started, talk through the problem with a friend or peer
 - **Use Resources**

   - Googling and looking up documentation are key coding skills
 - **Trust your own process**

   - Try to avoid using AI to make structural decisions about your code

## Tackling Difficult Problems


 - Above all, remember…

   - Coding can be hard!

 - It can feel like you are running into the same problems over and over again sometimes

   - This is a normal part of the process
 - If you keep trying *you will get there*

## A Worked Example


 - Let's go through an example together to see these principles in action:
 
 > **Question:** Write some code which, for a given positive integer $n$, finds the largest prime number that is less than or equal to $n$.
 
 - Principles:
   - Plan before you code
   - Clarify inputs and outputs 
   - Look for structure and repetition
   - Divide and conquer
   - Talk things through
   - Trust your own process

```{pyodide}
#| caption: "▶ Ctrl/Cmd+Enter | ⇥ Ctrl/Cmd+] | ⇤ Ctrl/Cmd+["

# Write your code here...
```

## Practical

 - We now move over to Python
 - Please open [week_05_home.ipynb](./week_05_home.qmd)
 - For the rest of today, you must work through a Python notebook
 - This week is a little different...
 - Please choose the challenge according to your course
   - [Chemistry Challenge](week_05_chemistry.qmd)
   - [Data Science Challenge](week_05_data_science.qmd)
   - [Physics Challenge](week_05_physics.qmd)
