## Beginner: If Statements

**Question 1:** The answer to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
# Create a string containing your last (or first) name
name = "Anderson"

# Check if the length of the string is greater than 8
if len(name) > 8:
    print("The name is long")
```

**Question 2:** The code for this question is below.

```{pyodide}
# The pH level
ph_level = 6

if ph_level < 0 or ph_level > 14:
    liquid_type = "unknown"
elif ph_level < 7:
    liquid_type = "acid"
elif ph_level == 7:
    liquid_type = "neutral"
else:
    liquid_type = "alkali"

print(liquid_type)
```

**Question 3:** The problem with this code is that the boolean for the `if` evaluates as `True` when the `temperature` exceeds 100, so the `elif` is never executed. A simple solution would be to switch the order of the clauses like so:

```{pyodide}
# Temperature in degrees celcius
temperature = 120 

if temperature > 100:
    state = "gas"
elif temperature > 0:
    state = "liquid"
else:
    state = "solid"

print("State of water:", state)
```

**Question 4:** The code for this question is below:

```{pyodide}
# Example input
day_number = 32   # February 1st

# Work out the month
if day_number <= 31:
    month = "January"
elif day_number <= 59:   # 31 + 28
    month = "February"
elif day_number <= 90:   # 59 + 31
    month = "March"
elif day_number <= 120:  # 90 + 30
    month = "April"
elif day_number <= 151:  # 120 + 31
    month = "May"
elif day_number <= 181:  # 151 + 30
    month = "June"
elif day_number <= 212:  # 181 + 31
    month = "July"
elif day_number <= 243:  # 212 + 31
    month = "August"
elif day_number <= 273:  # 243 + 30
    month = "September"
elif day_number <= 304:  # 273 + 31
    month = "October"
elif day_number <= 334:  # 304 + 30
    month = "November"
else:                    # 334 + 31
    month = "December"

print(month)
```

**Question 5:** One potential solution to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
# The number of days
day_number = 399

# Wrap the day_number so it always falls between 1 and 365
day_number = day_number % 365
if day_number == 0:
    day_number = 365

# Work out the month
if day_number <= 31:
    month = "January"
elif day_number <= 59:   # 31 + 28
    month = "February"
elif day_number <= 90:   # 59 + 31
    month = "March"
elif day_number <= 120:  # 90 + 30
    month = "April"
elif day_number <= 151:  # 120 + 31
    month = "May"
elif day_number <= 181:  # 151 + 30
    month = "June"
elif day_number <= 212:  # 181 + 31
    month = "July"
elif day_number <= 243:  # 212 + 31
    month = "August"
elif day_number <= 273:  # 243 + 30
    month = "September"
elif day_number <= 304:  # 273 + 31
    month = "October"
elif day_number <= 334:  # 304 + 30
    month = "November"
else:                    # 334 + 31
    month = "December"

print(month)
```

**Question 6:** An answer to this question is given below.

```{pyodide}
# Distance in kilometres
distance_km = 3.0

# Convert to miles
distance_in_miles = distance_km / 1.60934

# Check conditions
if distance_in_miles > 2:
    print("Distance is more than 2 miles")
else:
    print("Distance is short")

if distance_in_miles > 1:
    print("Distance is more than 1 mile")
```

**Question 7:** A solution to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
year = 1900

if year % 400 == 0:                         # Added line
    leap_year = "Yes"                       # Added line
elif year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 == 0:    # if --> elif
    leap_year = "No"
elif year % 4 == 0:
    leap_year = "Yes"
else:
    leap_year = "No"

print(f"Is {year} a leap year? {leap_year}")
```

 > **Question 7:** This question may feel daunting to students at first. In reality, the solution only requires adding the first clause (`year % 400 == 0`). One way to help is to have students test a few example years on paper before coding so the logic becomes clearer. Only encourage them to start coding once you feel they have a strong conceptual grasp of the problem.

**Question 8:** The `pass` statement is a placeholder which effectively does nothing. If it were not there, we would have a `SyntaxError` as the `if` statement must contain code.

**Question 9:** An answer to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
# The previous player's answer
prev_answer = "Fizz"

# The previous player's number
prev_number = 6

# Work out what the previous player's answer should have been
if prev_number % 3 == 0 and prev_number % 5 == 0:
    correct_prev = "FizzBuzz"
elif prev_number % 3 == 0:
    correct_prev = "Fizz"
elif prev_number % 5 == 0:
    correct_prev = "Buzz"
else:
    correct_prev = str(prev_number)

# Check if their answer was correct
if prev_answer != correct_prev:
    print(f"Oops! The previous player should have said '{correct_prev}', not '{prev_answer}'.")

# Work out and print your answer (for the next number)
my_number = prev_number + 1

if my_number % 3 == 0 and my_number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
elif my_number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
elif my_number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
else:
    print(str(my_number))
```

**Question 10:** The desired answer is below:

```{pyodide}
x = 30
z = 4

if z < 0 and (x < 20 or x > 30):
    print("A")
elif z < 0:
    print("B")
```

An alternative is given by:

```{pyodide}
x = 30
z = 4

if z < 0 and (20 <= x <= 30):
    print("B")
elif z < 0:
    print("A")
```

## Intermediate: Match Statements

**Question 1:** The answer to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
# Point in space
point = (1, 5)

# Match statement
match point:
    case (0, y) if y > 0:
        location = "on the positive y-axis"
    case (0, y) if y < 0:
        location = "on the negative y-axis"
    case (x, 0) if x > 0:
        location = "on the positive x-axis"
    case (x, 0) if x < 0:
        location = "on the negative x-axis"
    case (0, 0):
        location = "at the origin"
    case (x, y) if x > 0 and y > 0:
        location = "in the upper right quadrant"
    case (x, y) if x > 0 and y < 0:
        location = "in the lower right quadrant"
    case (x, y) if x < 0 and y < 0:
        location = "in the lower left quadrant"
    case (x, y) if x < 0 and y > 0:
        location = "in the upper left quadrant"

# Describe where the point is
print(f"The point {point} is {location}.")
```

**Question 2:** The solution to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
x = 2

match x:
    case 1:
        print("one")
    case 2:
        print("two")
    case 3:
        print("three")
    case _:
        print("something else")
```

**Question 3:** A model answer is given below:

```{pyodide}
# Example input
a = 10
b = 5
operator = "*"

# Match statement to apply the operation
match operator:
    case "+":
        my_result = a + b
    case "-":
        my_result = a - b
    case "*":
        my_result = a * b
    case "/":
        my_result = a / b
    case _:
        my_result = "Invalid operator"

print(my_result)
```

**Question 4:** An example solution is provided below:

```{pyodide}
# Exchange rates as of Sept 6, 2025 (3 s.f.)
GBP_TO_USD = 1.35
GBP_TO_EUR = 1.15
GBP_TO_JPY = 199

# Example input
account = (100, "USD")      # 100 dollars
target_currency = "EUR"     # convert to euros

# --- Step 1: convert original balance into GBP ---
match account:
    case (balance, "GBP"):
        balance_gbp = balance
    case (balance, "USD"):
        balance_gbp = balance / GBP_TO_USD
    case (balance, "EUR"):
        balance_gbp = balance / GBP_TO_EUR
    case (balance, "JPY"):
        balance_gbp = balance / GBP_TO_JPY
    case _:
        balance_gbp = None

# --- Step 2: convert GBP into target currency ---
match target_currency:
    case "GBP" if balance_gbp is not None:
        print(f"Balance: £{balance_gbp:.2f}")
    case "USD" if balance_gbp is not None:
        print(f"Balance: ${balance_gbp * GBP_TO_USD:.2f}")
    case "EUR" if balance_gbp is not None:
        print(f"Balance: €{balance_gbp * GBP_TO_EUR:.2f}")
    case "JPY" if balance_gbp is not None:
        print(f"Balance: ¥{balance_gbp * GBP_TO_JPY:.0f}")
    case _:
        print("Unsupported currency")
```

**Question 5:** Below is a solution to this exercise:

```{pyodide}
# Example rgb values
rgb_values = (10,223,20)

match rgb_values:

    case (r,g,b) if (r > 200) and (g < 50) and (b < 50):

        color_name = "Red"

    case (r,g,b) if (g > 200) and (b < 50) and (r < 50):

        color_name = "Green"

    case (r,g,b) if (b > 200) and (r < 50) and (g < 50):

        color_name = "Blue"

    case _:

        color_name = "Unknown"

print(color_name)
```

## Advanced: Conditional Expressions and Lazy Evaluation

**Question 1:** An answer to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
# Variables x and y
x = 4
y = 2

# Compute the maximum using a conditional expression
max_xy = x if x > y else y

# print the result
print(max_xy)
```

 > **Demonstrator Notes:** The logic in this question is very similar to the absolute value example in the `Conditional Expressions` section. If students are unsure what to do here, begin by referring them back to this example.

**Question 2:** The answers to this question, alongside commented code are given below:

```{pyodide}
# my_variable = True and 1/0        # Division by zero error
# my_variable = False and 1/0       # No error, False assigned to my_variable
# my_variable = str(False and 1/0)  # No error, "False" assigned to my_variable
# my_variable = str(False) and 1/0  # Division by zero error
```

**Question 3:** When Python evaluates an and expression, it checks the left-hand side first.

 - If `my_boolean` is `True`, the right-hand side (`print(...)`) must also be evaluated, so the message is printed.

 - If `my_boolean` is `False`, Python stops immediately, as it knows the `and` must be `False`, and the right-hand side is never run - so nothing is printed.

**Question 4:** An answer to this question is given below:

```{pyodide}
my_boolean = True

# Answer
output = (my_boolean and print("This code is printing")) or (not my_boolean and print("This code is printing2"))
```

**Question 5:** The rule for evaluating `x or y` is:

 - If `x` is `Truthy`, return `x`.
 - If `x` is `Falsy`, return `y`.

This is the mirror image of how `and` works. Some example code is given by:

```{pyodide}
x = 0
y = "hello"

result = x or y
print(result)   # Output: hello
```
