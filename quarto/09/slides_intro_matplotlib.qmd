## Before we start
### Project 2 release

- Project 2 is being released this week (Wednesday 19 at 12h00)
- The tasks require you to **solve a scientific problem and complete a template Notebook**. 
- You will have to write some code and some reflections on your code
- No use of **autograding**: follow the instructions on **Blackboard**
    - Download from Blackboard
    - Upload to Noteable for editing
    - Complete the asssignment
    - Download and upload back to the submission point on **Blackboard**
    
- The assignment will be marked by your tutors.
    

## Before we start
### Project 2 release

**Tips**:

- Write clear code (comments, variable names, structure) Follow the advice provided during the tutorials.
- Do not overcomplicate (all tasks have relatively simplease solutions).
- Demonstrate understanding (using comments and in the mandatory Markdown explanation boxes)
    

## Today

- Basics of plotting in Python using `matplotlib`
- Reading and plotting from file
- Some extra decorating tasks

## What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib is a powerful and widely-used Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. 

**Why do we need plotting?**
- Visualize patterns in data
- Communicate results effectively
- Explore relationships between variables
- Present findings to others

## Getting Started

**Question**: How do we import matplotlib for plotting?

```{pyodide}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

The most widespread convention is to use the shorthand `plt` to refer to the pyplot submodule. 

This was created to replicate the functionality of MATLAB, which many early Python adopters were familiar with.

## Two Main Approaches

**Problem**: There are different ways to create plots in matplotlib. Which should we choose?

### Pyplot Interface

```python
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

- MATLAB-style syntax (if you know MATLAB)
- Quick and simple for basic plots
- Often seen in online examples

## Two Main Approaches 

### Object-Oriented Approach  
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
```
- More modern and explicit
- `fig` and `ax` are Python **objects**: with the `.` you can explore all the things they can do and they can be passed to functions
- **Recommended approach**

## Understanding Figure and Axes

**Question**: What's the difference between a Figure and Axes?

```{pyodide}
#| output-location: fragment
# Create a Figure (canvas) and Axes (plotting area)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))

# Generate sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)
y = np.sin(x)

ax.plot(x, y)
ax.text(2,0,"Hello!") # the coordinates are in data units here
fig.text(0.9, 0.5,"Goodbye!") # the coordinates are in precentage of width, height
plt.show()
```

- **Figure**: The entire canvas - like a piece of paper
- **Axes**: The plotting area with x-y coordinates - where data goes

## What Types of Plots Can We Create?

**Problem**: We have different types of data - how do we choose the right visualization?

### Continuous Relationships
```python
ax.plot(x, y)        # Line plot
ax.scatter(x, y)     # Scatter plot
```
**When to use**: Time series, correlations

### Distributions
```python
ax.hist(data)        # Histogram
ax.bar(categories, values)  # Bar plot
```
**When to use**: Frequency distributions, comparisons

## Real Example: Combining Visualizations

**Scenario**: We have measurements and a fitted model. How do we show both?

```{pyodide}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Create sample data representing real measurements vs theory
np.random.seed(42)
x = np.arange(1, 56, 5)
y1 = x**2  # Theoretical relationship
y2 = x**2 + np.random.normal(size=len(x))*100  # Noisy measurements

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
ax.plot(x, y1, label='Theoretical model')      
ax.scatter(x, y2, label='Experimental data')   
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel("Input variable")
ax.set_ylabel("Response")
plt.show()
```


## Customising plots

**Problem**: Default plots often look bland. How do we make them professional?

```{pyodide}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))

# Same data, but now with intention behind each choice
ax.plot(x, y1, color="slategrey", linestyle="--", 
        linewidth=2, label="Theoretical model")
ax.scatter(x, y2, color="indianred", marker='+', s=60, 
           label="Experimental data")

# Clear, informative labels
ax.set_xlabel("Distance (m)", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Force (N)", fontsize=12)
ax.set_xlim(0, 52)
ax.legend(fontsize=10)
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)  # Subtle grid helps reading values
plt.show()
```

## Anatomy of a Figure

![](images/Anatomy_plot_matplotlib.png)

Understanding these components helps you customize any part of your plot

## Workshop today

- In the lecture, you will find some inline **Exercises A** and **B** demonstrating the rudimenst of plotting: we will go through this together to discover the essential syntax.
- You will then be able to complete **Exercise C** where we read in some data and plot it.
- You will finally be able to experiment with matplotlib in a separate sheet named [fun_matplotlib_decoration.ipynb](fun_matplotlib_decoration.qmd)
