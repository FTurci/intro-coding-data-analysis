jupyter: python3
---


This notebook contains exercises on basic pandas data structures including DataFrames and Series. Each exercise is followed by its solution.

We'll use real datasets from online sources to make the exercises more interesting and practical.


## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries:

```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Exercise 1: Creating DataFrames from dictionaries

Create a pandas DataFrame called `elements_df` containing information about chemical elements with the following data:

- Element names "Hydrogen", "Helium", "Lithium", "Beryllium", "Boron"
- Symbols: "H", "He", "Li", "Be", "B"
- Atomic numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Atomic masses: 1.008, 4.003, 6.941, 9.012, 10.81

The column names should be: "name", "symbol", "atomic_number", "atomic_mass"

### Solution 1

```{pyodide}
elements_dict = {
    "name": ["Hydrogen", "Helium", "Lithium", "Beryllium", "Boron"],
    "symbol": ["H", "He", "Li", "Be", "B"],
    "atomic_number": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "atomic_mass": [1.008, 4.003, 6.941, 9.012, 10.81]
}

elements_df = pd.DataFrame(elements_dict)
elements_df
```

## Exercise 2: Setting and using indices

Using the `elements_df` DataFrame from Exercise 1:

a) Set the "symbol" column as the index

b) Access the row for "Li" using `.loc[]`

c) Extract just the atomic mass for "He"

### Solution 2

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Set symbol as index
elements_df = elements_df.set_index("symbol")
elements_df
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Access row for Li
elements_df.loc["Li"]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Extract atomic mass for He
elements_df.loc["He", "atomic_mass"]
```

## Exercise 3: Working with real data - Tips Dataset

Let's load a real dataset from an online source. We'll use the famous "tips" dataset which contains information about restaurant tips.

```{pyodide}
# Load the tips dataset from a reliable online source
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv"
tips_df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows
tips_df.head()
```

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Display the column names

b) Display the shape of the DataFrame (number of rows and columns)

c) Extract the "total_bill" column

d) Find the data type (dtype) of the "day" column

e) Display the last 8 rows of the DataFrame

### Solution 3

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Column names
tips_df.columns
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Shape
tips_df.shape
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Extract total_bill column
tips_df["total_bill"]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: Data type of day column
tips_df["day"].dtype
```

```{pyodide}
# Part e: Last 8 rows
tips_df.tail(8)
```

## Exercise 4: Statistical operations

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Calculate the mean of the "total_bill" column

b) Find the maximum tip amount

c) Find the minimum tip amount

d) Calculate the standard deviation of the "tip" column

e) Find the index (row position) of the maximum total bill

f) Use `.describe()` to get summary statistics for all numeric columns

### Solution 4

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Mean total bill
tips_df["total_bill"].mean()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Maximum tip
tips_df["tip"].max()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Minimum tip
tips_df["tip"].min()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: Standard deviation of tips
tips_df["tip"].std()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part e: Index of maximum total bill
tips_df["total_bill"].idxmax()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part f: Summary statistics
tips_df.describe()
```

## Exercise 5: Arithmetic operations

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Create a new column called "tip_percentage" that calculates the tip as a percentage of the total bill (multiply by 100 to get percentage)

b) Create a new column called "total_cost" that adds the total_bill and tip together

c) Calculate the mean tip percentage

### Solution 5

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Tip percentage
tips_df["tip_percentage"] = (tips_df["tip"] / tips_df["total_bill"]) * 100
tips_df.head()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Total cost
tips_df["total_cost"] = tips_df["total_bill"] + tips_df["tip"]
tips_df.head()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Mean tip percentage
tips_df["tip_percentage"].mean()
```

## Exercise 6: Filtering data (single conditions)

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Filter to show only rows where the total_bill is greater than 30

b) Filter to show only rows where the day is "Sun"

c) Filter to show only rows where the tip percentage (from Exercise 5) is greater than 20%

d) How many rows have a total bill greater than 40? (Hint: use `.shape` or `len()`)

### Solution 6

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Total bill > 30
tips_df[tips_df["total_bill"] > 30]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Day is Sun
tips_df[tips_df["day"] == "Sun"]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Tip percentage > 20
tips_df[tips_df["tip_percentage"] > 20]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: Count of rows with total bill > 40
filtered_df = tips_df[tips_df["total_bill"] > 40]
print(f"Number of rows: {len(filtered_df)}")
# Alternative: filtered_df.shape[0]
```

## Exercise 7: Filtering with multiple conditions

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Filter to show rows where total_bill is greater than 20 **and** the day is "Sat"

b) Filter to show rows where tip is greater than 5 **and** size (party size) is greater than or equal to 4

c) Filter to show rows where the day is "Sat" **or** the day is "Sun"

d) Filter to show rows where total_bill is between 15 and 25 (inclusive)

### Solution 7

```{pyodide}
# Part a: total_bill > 20 AND day is Sat
tips_df[(tips_df["total_bill"] > 20) & (tips_df["day"] == "Sat")]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: tip > 5 AND size >= 4
tips_df[(tips_df["tip"] > 5) & (tips_df["size"] >= 4)]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: day is Sat OR day is Sun
tips_df[(tips_df["day"] == "Sat") | (tips_df["day"] == "Sun")]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: total_bill between 15 and 25
tips_df[(tips_df["total_bill"] >= 15) & (tips_df["total_bill"] <= 25)]
```

## Exercise 8: Working with another dataset - Iris

Let's work with the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers.

```{pyodide}
# Load the Iris dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"
iris_df = pd.read_csv(url)

iris_df.head()
```

Using the `iris_df` DataFrame:

a) Set the index to be a range from 1 to the number of rows (so it starts at 1 instead of 0)

b) Find how many unique species are in the dataset (Hint: use `.unique()` or `.nunique()`)

c) Calculate the mean sepal_length for all flowers

d) Filter to show only the "setosa" species

e) For the "setosa" species, what is the maximum petal_length?

f) Create a new column called "sepal_area" that multiplies sepal_length by sepal_width

g) Which species has the largest average sepal_area? (This requires filtering by each species)

### Solution 8

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Set index starting from 1
iris_df.index = range(1, len(iris_df) + 1)
iris_df.head()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Number of unique species
print(f"Unique species: {iris_df['species'].unique()}")
print(f"Number of unique species: {iris_df['species'].nunique()}")
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Mean sepal length
iris_df["sepal_length"].mean()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: Filter for setosa
iris_df[iris_df["species"] == "setosa"]
```

```{pyodide}
# Part e: Maximum petal length for setosa
setosa_df = iris_df[iris_df["species"] == "setosa"]
setosa_df["petal_length"].max()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part f: Create sepal_area column
iris_df["sepal_area"] = iris_df["sepal_length"] * iris_df["sepal_width"]
iris_df.head()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part g: Species with largest average sepal_area
setosa_mean = iris_df[iris_df["species"] == "setosa"]["sepal_area"].mean()
versicolor_mean = iris_df[iris_df["species"] == "versicolor"]["sepal_area"].mean()
virginica_mean = iris_df[iris_df["species"] == "virginica"]["sepal_area"].mean()

print(f"Setosa mean sepal area: {setosa_mean:.2f}")
print(f"Versicolor mean sepal area: {versicolor_mean:.2f}")
print(f"Virginica mean sepal area: {virginica_mean:.2f}")

# Find the maximum
species_means = {
    "setosa": setosa_mean,
    "versicolor": versicolor_mean,
    "virginica": virginica_mean
}
max_species = max(species_means, key=species_means.get)
print(f"\nSpecies with largest average sepal area: {max_species}")
```

## Exercise 9: Series operations

Create two pandas Series and perform operations on them:

a) Create a Series called `temps_celsius` with the following data:
   - Index: ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome"]
   - Values: [15, 18, 14, 22, 24]

b) Create a Series called `temps_fahrenheit` that converts the Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

c) Create a new Series called `humidity` with the same cities as index and values: [75, 65, 70, 55, 60]

d) Calculate the average temperature across all cities (in Celsius)

e) Find which city has the highest temperature

### Solution 9

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Create temps_celsius Series
temps_celsius = pd.Series(
    [15, 18, 14, 22, 24],
    index=["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome"]
)
temps_celsius
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Convert to Fahrenheit
temps_fahrenheit = (temps_celsius * 9/5) + 32
temps_fahrenheit
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Create humidity Series
humidity = pd.Series(
    [75, 65, 70, 55, 60],
    index=["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome"]
)
humidity
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: Average temperature
temps_celsius.mean()
```

```{pyodide}
# Part e: City with highest temperature
temps_celsius.idxmax()
```

## Exercise 10: Challenge - Planets Dataset

Let's work with a dataset about planets in our solar system.

```{pyodide}
# Load planets dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/planets.csv"
planets_df = pd.read_csv(url)

planets_df.head(10)
```

This dataset contains information about discovered exoplanets (planets outside our solar system).

**Challenge tasks:**

a) How many planets were discovered in the year 2010?

b) What is the most common discovery method?

c) Calculate the average orbital period for all planets (note: there may be missing values)

d) Filter to show planets discovered by the "Transit" method with an orbital period less than 10 days

e) Create a new column called "discovery_decade" that shows which decade each planet was discovered (e.g., 2000s, 2010s)
   - Hint: You can use integer division: `(year // 10) * 10` to get the decade

f) What percentage of all planets were discovered using the "Radial Velocity" method?

### Solution 10

```{pyodide}
# Part a: Planets discovered in 2010
planets_2010 = planets_df[planets_df["year"] == 2010]
print(f"Number of planets discovered in 2010: {len(planets_2010)}")
```

```{pyodide}
# Part b: Most common discovery method
print(planets_df["method"].value_counts())
print(f"\nMost common method: {planets_df['method'].value_counts().idxmax()}")
```

```{pyodide}
# Part c: Average orbital period (ignoring NaN values)
print(f"Average orbital period: {planets_df['orbital_period'].mean():.2f} days")
```

```{pyodide}
# Part d: Transit method with orbital period < 10 days
transit_short = planets_df[
    (planets_df["method"] == "Transit") & 
    (planets_df["orbital_period"] < 10)
]
transit_short
```

```{pyodide}
# Part e: Discovery decade
planets_df["discovery_decade"] = (planets_df["year"] // 10) * 10
planets_df[["year", "discovery_decade"]].head(10)
```

```{pyodide}
# Part f: Percentage of Radial Velocity discoveries
total_planets = len(planets_df)
radial_velocity_planets = len(planets_df[planets_df["method"] == "Radial Velocity"])
percentage = (radial_velocity_planets / total_planets) * 100

print(f"Total planets: {total_planets}")
print(f"Radial Velocity planets: {radial_velocity_planets}")
print(f"Percentage: {percentage:.2f}%")
```
