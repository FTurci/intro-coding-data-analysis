## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries:


```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Exercise 1: Creating DataFrames from dictionaries

Create a pandas DataFrame called `elements_df` containing information about chemical elements with the following data:

- Element names  "Hydrogen", "Helium", "Lithium", "Beryllium", "Boron"
- Symbols  "H", "He", "Li", "Be", "B"
- Atomic numbers  1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Atomic masses  1.008, 4.003, 6.941, 9.012, 10.81

The column names should be: "name", "symbol", "atomic_number", "atomic_mass"

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Exercise 2: Setting and using indices

Using the `elements_df` DataFrame from Exercise 1:

a) Set the "symbol" column as the index

b) Access the row for "Li" using `.loc[]`

c) Extract just the atomic mass for "He"

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

## Exercise 3: Working with real data - Tips Dataset

Let's load a real dataset from an online source. We'll use the famous "tips" dataset which contains information about restaurant tips.

```{pyodide}
# Load the tips dataset from a reliable online source
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv"
tips_df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows
tips_df.head()
```

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Display the column names

b) Display the shape of the DataFrame (number of rows and columns)

c) Extract the "total_bill" column

d) Find the data type (dtype) of the "day" column

e) Display the last 8 rows of the DataFrame

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part d
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part e
```

## Exercise 4: Statistical operations

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Calculate the mean of the "total_bill" column

b) Find the maximum tip amount

c) Find the minimum tip amount

d) Calculate the standard deviation of the "tip" column

e) Find the index (row position) of the maximum total bill

f) Use `.describe()` to get summary statistics for all numeric columns

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part d
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part e
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part f
```

## Exercise 5: Arithmetic operations

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Create a new column called "tip_percentage" that calculates the tip as a percentage of the total bill (multiply by 100 to get percentage)

b) Create a new column called "total_cost" that adds the total_bill and tip together

c) Calculate the mean tip percentage

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

## Exercise 6: Filtering data (single conditions)

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Filter to show only rows where the total_bill is greater than 30

b) Filter to show only rows where the day is "Sun"

c) Filter to show only rows where the tip percentage (from Exercise 5) is greater than 20%

d) How many rows have a total bill greater than 40? (Hint: use `.shape` or `len()`)

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part d
```

## Exercise 7: Filtering with multiple conditions

Using the `tips_df` DataFrame:

a) Filter to show rows where total_bill is greater than 20 **and** the day is "Sat"

b) Filter to show rows where tip is greater than 5 **and** size (party size) is greater than or equal to 4

c) Filter to show rows where the day is "Sat" **or** the day is "Sun"

d) Filter to show rows where total_bill is between 15 and 25 (inclusive)

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part d
```

## Exercise 8: Working with another dataset - Iris

Let's work with the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers.

```{pyodide}
# Load the Iris dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"
iris_df = pd.read_csv(url)

iris_df.head()
```

Using the `iris_df` DataFrame:

a) Set the index to be a range from 1 to the number of rows (so it starts at 1 instead of 0)

b) Find how many unique species are in the dataset (Hint: use `.unique()` or `.nunique()`)

c) Calculate the mean sepal_length for all flowers

d) Filter to show only the "setosa" species

e) For the "setosa" species, what is the maximum petal_length?

f) Create a new column called "sepal_area" that multiplies sepal_length by sepal_width

g) Which species has the largest average sepal_area? (This requires filtering by each species)

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part d
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part e
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part f
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part g
```

## Exercise 9: Series operations

Create two pandas Series and perform operations on them:

a) Create a Series called `temps_celsius` with the following data:
   - Index: ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome"]
   - Values: [15, 18, 14, 22, 24]

b) Create a Series called `temps_fahrenheit` that converts the Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

c) Create a new Series called `humidity` with the same cities as index and values: [75, 65, 70, 55, 60]

d) Calculate the average temperature across all cities (in Celsius)

e) Find which city has the highest temperature

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part a
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part b
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part c
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part d
```

```{pyodide}
### YOUR CODE HERE - part e
```

## Exercise 10: Challenge - Planets Dataset

Let's work with a dataset about planets in our solar system.

```{pyodide}
# Load planets dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/planets.csv"
planets_df = pd.read_csv(url)

planets_df.head(10)
```

This dataset contains information about discovered exoplanets (planets outside our solar system).

**Challenge tasks:**

a) How many planets were discovered in the year 2010?

b) What is the most common discovery method?

c) Calculate the average orbital period for all planets (note: there may be missing values)

d) Filter to show planets discovered by the "Transit" method with an orbital period less than 10 days

e) Create a new column called "discovery_decade" that shows which decade each planet was discovered (e.g., 2000s, 2010s)
   - Hint: You can use integer division: `(year // 10) * 10` to get the decade

f) What percentage of all planets were discovered using the "Radial Velocity" method?
