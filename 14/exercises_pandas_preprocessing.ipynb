    "- **`tmax`**: Maximum temperature for the month (°C)\n",
    "- **`tmin`**: Minimum temperature for the month (°C)\n",
    "- **`af`**: Air frost days - number of days when temperature fell below 0°C\n",
    "- **`rain`**: Total monthly rainfall (millimeters)\n",
    "- **`sun`**: Total monthly sunshine duration (hours)\n",
    "\n",

    "**Goal**: Load the weather data, skipping metadata, and display the first rows to verify.\n",

    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- `pd.read_csv(url, ...)`: Reads data from a URL or file path\n",
    "- the option `skiprows=[0,1,2,3]` can skip specific lines (in this case line 0,1,2,3)\n",
