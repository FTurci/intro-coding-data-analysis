The important part is thinking about how the data will be used. For example, if we need to look up information by subject name, a dictionary of dictionaries might be best; if we want to work with all weights at once (e.g. to build a histogram), a dictionary of lists is more convenient. Emphasise that the choice of data structure depends on the task - there isn’t one 'right' answer."

Therefore, when we perform `list_a.append(4)`, the change is reflected in both `list_a` and `list_b`. Encourage students to think about how they could gain the desired behaviour using the `.copy()` function (e.g. `list_b = list_a.copy()`)."
